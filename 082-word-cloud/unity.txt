Veterans for Nike! I support Nike! Semper Fi!
is more concerned with pleasing the looting crowd than those who support the police!
America shows how racist they are when they'd rarher and burn merchandize then support a knee against police brutality. I'm bout to buy my whole family new nikes! Stay strong
I just threw out my and bought a pair of
And Ill just say it LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK...destroying merchandise you already bought doesnt hurt a company...and by broadcasting it your hyping the brand more
Hey I want to buy whatever product you got going. Could you do me a solid and make sure theyre made in the USA by workers paid a fair share? Thanks, brotha.
This here is hilarious.. is big mad Man dont nobody give a damn about anything that comes out your mouth bruh, except for the ones who voted for ya! I support
Burning your nike gear does nothing. The money is already in their pockets. If you feel that morally conflicted...DONATE YOUR STUFF. Someone less fortunate could use it. Dummies.
Finally! is facing the consequences of their decision to Just Do It instead of really thinking things through and making good decisions.
If yall dont want yall Nike gear, just slide it my way instead of burning it......
Hey I stopped buying your products years ago because of your shady business practices. But as soon as i see in an ad ill buy whatever he sells.
Of course I think this whole burning-your-Nike is ridiculous. But I think it also illustrates why we cant change the mind of a Trumpster: they know theyre objects of ridicule and contempt and so have no incentive to try to view things from our perspective.
Everyone's just gonna lie about the socks they wear and switch to wearing no show Nike socks.
for those that are supporting this stupid/ignorant ... its all good trust me they got enough people that will still be buying them my community got they back ... more lit products for us
I dunno but maybe burning shoes youve spent good money on to own is pretty short sighted. Those Asian wage slaves worked hard for your overvalued status symbol, brah.
I just bought 4 pairs of Air Max 90s.
Are you still a Nike supporter?!?
People burning away money they already gave is kind of ridiculous. If you want the to be affective then dont buy anymore of their products, dont give them anymore of your money
Turns out that all those kids stealing Jordans were just taking back the symbol of the revolution
*ahem* give me ya Nike clothes if ur ‚Äòboycotting! times are rough in my household!! instead of wasting your money, GIVE ME YA STUFF
NIKE - Just don't do it Say NO to
HEY IDIOTS:You need to burn the new Converse shoes you bought to replace the Nike Shoes that you just burned.. NIKE OWNS CONVERSE
Im burning my Skechers later today. No relation to anyone doing the just trying to move on from the worst drunk decision I ever made
I am calling all those pussies burning their shoes to show how upset they are. Buy some vintage Jordan's and burn them
. Has Nike lost it's mind? Why would they think that this is a good idea. This will be taught in business schools from now on in Marketing 101. HOW TO KILL YOUR BRAND AND YOUR MARKET.

You guys are scum. Just bc you don't approve of 's support of doesn't mean you need to use this late soldier's image to fuel your agenda. You don't know what Pat Tillman would've done. Shame on you!
most disgusting g thing ever. Kapernick disrepects our flag. He and Brennan should move to a communist country if you dont want to live her. Nike , our vets are the ones that sacrificed for our country. Not a dumb football player
See the thing is if you're on you don't need Nikes or shoes so just come over and join us for some fun!
We have a sexual harasser as President, thst has trashed vets like mccain and some people wanna create false outrage to cloak their imbedded racism about a civilian practicing everything this country stands for? Youre not stupid, just hateful
All of this business surrounding the I find absolutely absurd!!! People it doesnt matter what you think of the guy who they chose to represent the ad campaign, you are ruining good, usable clothing! Some cant even say they have that.
Ill never wear/buy again! What is it w/these Anti-American, virtue signaling companies committing business suicide? Mixing Politics & Business hurts shareholders! Sell, Sell, Sell!
I wonder how many of the same people that laughed at me when I boycotted are now part of the . We stand by our beliefs. I stand to protect children.
Let's say it again, for those in the back. Pat Tillmans widow wants you to stop using her husband to bash y'all apparently didn't really know or his politics.
Nike is playing the long game while simple minded individuals r focusing on the now.
Let us know when you have not lost your mind I buy 100 plus Nikes a year not counting jerseys and other items. Stupid Move!
We have a sexual harasser as President, thst has trashed vets like mccain and some people wanna create false outrage to cloak their imbedded racism about a civilian practicing everything this country stands for? Youre not stupid, just hateful
I support your just don't take the shoes off before you burn them.
Wont be making any further purchases on what used to be my favorite app
All because wouldn't stay out of other people's affairs.
(2/2) But where is this when it comes to talk of sweat shops and working conditions overseas.I guess it's okay in some people's eyes to exploit people of color. Showing them support is going too far, though.
We should all flood this guy's PO box with shoes. But NOT Nikes... burn those things, then go buy a brand new pair of New Balance shoes to send to him. New Balance shoes are made in America, AND they support conservatives.
supports the guy who disrespects the flag (i.e. country),and wore socks depicting police as pigs? Bye Nike!
Not only does Nike hate America, our military and the American Flag. THEY SUPPORT CHILD LABOR.
They like to Let It Burn like Usher
Buzz Aldrin should be the face of because he, and others, did risk everything!!
Tell us more
Eggs+Nike shoes in store = stock crash. Dont burn shit you already paid for just think like a liberal for a day and " just vandalize it".
Only in America would you get something as ridiculous as a most dysfunctional country on the planet! Riddled with complete and utter assholes..
Never bought Nike before. But the has got me pumped up to start buying Nike. Luv that Nike isn't backing down to those jealous racists who are burning clothes and shoes they spent so much money on. How stupid!!
BREAKING Liberal owned companys and saved so much $$ from the Trump tax cuts they can now afford to alienate half of their customer base.
...glad my husband and I got Salomons this last time
I spent well over $500 for back to school clothes today. I refused to buy one product today. congratulations.
If you feel the need to burn, destroy or discard your Nike shoes and apparel over Colin Kaepernicks new ‚ÄòJust Do It ads - please do not do it!Instead, please give / donate them to anyone of our homeless men, women, children and veterans.
Yall think we give a damn about yall cutting up yall Nike??? & Dont! Get that mad about Racial Injustice & Racism in this country! Stupid asses!
Nice to see man and dog unite together as one for the common good
faithful Nike supporter/customer for nearly 40 years. Ill never buy again.
So I see people burning Nike clothes.. why not take them to Good Will? Or donated to a family I'm sure they won't complain. Plus anything size XL I will take off your hands as well. Thanks. Cause I honestly don't care who the face is.
For sure out, won't buy this brand anymore, anyone not standing for USA should not represent any brand
Haha. Go ahead and burn your Nikes. Now youre just a barefoot asshole with no shoes.
I will take a pair of those Nike shoes that are destroying because they think burning something they already paid money for is .Repost
Can we start a thing where we just take pictures of old white men shitting or buying beer during the and hope there is suddenly a ban on cargo shorts and those hats with beer funnels?
Another definition of "Stupid": When people that have paid their money to Nike for clothes, shoes, etc and then - THEN - set those same items on fire or otherwise destroy them in some sort of weird statement. Nike already made your money you idiots.
The same people who are upset at Nike and Colin Kaepernick are the same people who pushed to elect a man who saw his sexual conquests as his personal Vietnam. You don't give a shit about military sacrifice. You just need a context for you anger. is nonsense
Wearing at the gym cuz Im all grown up and dont waste money or give a crap who they use for advertising no here Just comfy gym shoes.
I guess only likes people that plays with balls instead of real men and women that actually contribute to society that keeps our country going.
Had Kaepernick gone this route instead of attacking the Anthem, hed still be playing. But does he truly believe in this Nike ‚Äòad? Yes? Then he should drop the lawsuit now. Stop Refusing The Sacrifice!
Hope you mean that because Nike just sacrificed sales, market share and revenue. My 1st pair: Waffle Trainers My last pair: The Air Zooms I just threw away Goodbye
Ok, but do y'all really think Nike cares if you burn their socks? I don't fully agree with but that's just childish. Give them to Goodwill or anybody for that matter.
For all the people burning new Nikes to own us Libs & boycott ,Im looking for a size womens 6! White,black & I dont have a Democrat blue colored pair yet. Preferably new/too late to return. I have a Keurig already, TY!

YO! To anyone whos literally lighting their shoes on fire will you please just atleast give them to people/youngins in need of shoes. Some people dont have the kind of money to just be burning shoes.
You know that doesn't give a fuck if you burn your shoes, you already paid for them. Think before you do stupid shit just give them away or smth.
I'd just like to know how Downy got in there...
Dump this anti-police, anti-military company!! Nike is treasonous!!!! Burn in Hell you awful company!!!!!!!!
If you must get rid of your Nike, donate them to people experiencing homelessness. Size 11 mens in high demand.
YES! YES! YES! Awesome news!Music to my earsNIKE stock lost 3 Billion today! Boycott campaign is working! Don't give up MAGA ~ not an inch! Show , & some
I don't support crybabies or people who blame others for thier problems. I also don't support those that try to make our problems trivial as if they're just black or white. Rasicm is a poor misleading excuse. Never buying Nike again. is the way to go.

The news about supporting Colin Kaepernick. Whoever made the decision to support him should be fired. I'll also join the
Isn't racist to assume that only white folks support Trump?....
You all could've donated all of that nike gear to the homeless veterans you say Colin Kaepernick disrespected but you decided to burn and cut them up. This is why we cant take yall serious.
Not using Nike Run Club anymore. Use or instead. Nike makes it hard to get your data out, unlike the others. Get your Nike data exported using .
I support the Boycott and I hope most if not all Americans will also. Lets take on Nike America.
The is the dumbest and most useless boycott there is......
Kapernick  crusader without a cause! Attn NIKE : SJW's make piss poor CEO's. Thanks Harvard for nothing Harvard Biz
How to properly 1) dont buy thier stuff 2) support other business that align with your values 3) DONT BURN YOUR FEET IN AN IRONIC (moronic) FASHION
threw the national anthem under a bus just days before the season begins.
Because they are part of the Left, and they are making the same error as the the Left did when they were certain Hillary would win.Bad Business decision.
Imagine the chaos that would ensue if NASCAR came out in support of Kaepernick. There would be anarchy at every Wal-Mart and Piggly Wiggly south of the Mason-Dixon line.
LMFAOOOO "Make America Great Again" Twitter is in shambles behind Nike just wait until they find out they have to throw away their entire closet JOKES ON YOU!
Anyone who wears something like this and any company who supports someone who wears something like this -WILL NOT get my business!
If you are doing the and you have not served your country, don't talk to me about America and being a patriot, because you're a hypocrite and a fake. Now if you have, then we can have a civil conversation.
people make fun of other people rioting in their neighborhoods and breaking and burning things. These idiots are burning their own clothes. Probably the same idiots complaining about the rioters. And over something as silly as an ad campaign.
Imagine being this oppressed. Alexa, play A Thousand Miles by Vanessa Carlton.
this is what sacrifice looks like. Georgia officer wounded in Walmart shootout in serious condition, mouthed to his wife: 'I love you'
All these nuts burning remind me of those nuts that burned Beatles records after John Lennon's Jesus remarks. Small, narrow minded and stupid.
Me walking into the Nike store knowing Ill have no issue getting my size because of
it takes many levels of ignorance to burn your own nikes in defense of the USA. lmao wtf is this country??
Amazing that this whole is because we as a people are saying we should not die at the hands of Law Enforcement. If they can take a school shooter into custody, a church shooter to freakin BK without a scratch, but yet they kill us while we are unarmed.
Gonna buy even more Nike gear simply because they are backing up someone who openly speaks out against police brutality
is that supposed to be in support of veterans? If you really want to support veterans, enlist! But I'm sure you guys are way too busy for things like that.
I'll never buy another Nike anything again... Hope it was worth it to them.... there are deep lines being drawn in the sand.... Too bad these COMPANIES don't realize they are choosing to lose customers in large quantities, FOREVER......
Just doesnt make sense to me to burn shoes youve already bought to show how mad you are. Just give them to the homeless.
just do it
Im going to purchase some Nikes, then burn, That will definitely show them! They totally didnt just take my money
Kapernik SHOODNT b rewrded 4SUPPSDLY"standing"4cause dat he NEVER ACTUALLY DID ANYTHNG TOWARDS!OFF FIELD GO SPEAK-ON FIELD WORK
The sound of campus in Portland Oregon shrinking is deafening after some idiot decided was a great spokesperson. You know who else sucked at football and sold shoes?
why not use a hero for your ad rather than a scoundrel?
No Im not a supporter of a man who hates cops and this great nation but Im not gonna start boycotting and hating on a company just cuz theyre campaigning with him. Im just not gonna buy anything Nike. Its that simple
I'm finally glad I have a reason to boycott Nike. My son finally don't want Nike gear because of this, saving me thousands. Cha- ching $$$
Unemployed all non-void, walkin ‚Äòround like youre Pretty Boy Floyd...The truth is you are a terrible QB and unemployed because of it. The fact is that your nonsense on the field, kneeling, was only icing on a sh*t pie. I officially join club bcuz of this stupid ad
Sadly child sexual abuse is an issue often overlooked see the clip below Some will others will buy I don't care either way divisive Tweets will not bring solutions. Finding common ground is where it starts IMO. That seems hard to do
im going to have to get off SM until this stuff goes away. Im so tired of the divisiveness. Can ppl really not see BOTH sides to this issue?? You CAN love your country, respect veterans & law enforcement AND also want systematic racism to end.
If you dont agree with an athlete on something, you freak out as if your life has now changed. Enjoy sports. Use sports as a tool to teach your children about teamwork and working with people different than them.
As usual, the throng of fatherless males rush to support another bad cause lead by another mongrel. Different day... Same a-holes. You MFs will never learn.
Wheres the ? Ynot call Nike SOBs? He dares not because Nike is a tenant and he doesn't want to lose all that $! Where is his ? Trump Critical, But Says Nikes Kaepernick Deal ‚ÄòIs What This Country Is All About
Tillman or Alejandro Villanueva lineman, army ranger, bronze star, 3 tours in Afghanistan. Also representing Hispanic Americans, a true hero. has lost them $4.2 Billion just today.
*Liberals boycott In N Out over them donating to the GOP*Conservatives: Omg how pathetic just dont eat there*Nike campaigns with Colin Kaepernick*Conservatives: Were gonna boycott your company-Me: Yall are behaving like hypocrites
Some of the same people screaming didn't boycott the Catholic Church for molesting ya kids...what in the Alabama kinda logic is that?
Marvellous
Yeah I guess Pat Tillman the former Arizona Cardinal who gave up his NFL career to serve his Country proudly. He and gave his life for his Country so this Kapernick idiot can Just do it.
To the people destroying their nikes and hating on : What are you doing? What are you supporting?
Just because Nike decided to use Colin Kaepernick for their new campaign doesnt mean you have to use patriotism to hide unknown hypocrisy.
I see 's new slogan is "Just Doofus".
If anyone wants to do the just send me ur nike stuff ill wear it so u dont have to thx:))
Trumpers boycotting ? Fine with me. Now maybe Ill actually be able to find my size at Kohls. They still wont let me use a coupon for them though.
So wait... Nike stocks plummet 3.2% (3.16% close) so far because of the deal with Kaepernick. Someone's out there saying they lost billions of dollars, ok... But their stock is up 25% from last year... so.... now they only up 21.5%? Cause that's how I do math.
Does anyone think the Sneaker Heads will STOP buying ?Destroying your just requires you to buy more. won't last, Sneaker Heads are not going to buy New Balance or Skechers
Replacing all tennis Nike gear w & sneakers. You have no respect for me the Fan or I guess I dont fit your business model
Shame on you. It's for respect of your country to stand for it's anthem. It's not the person it's his blatant disrespect for his country.
Go ahead burn it. It just says something about you!!! Why can you not be tolerant and reasonable?
What the f? Nikes didn't hurt you. Just because you disagree with an every growing menagerie of non issues doesn't mean this is how you need to get your fifteen minutes of fame. Grow up.
Burning shoes releases toxics in the air and ground that causes cancer. Kneeling during the hurts no one.
Pro-trump civilians know nothing. I will proudly wear Nike (as I do everyday in some form) and proudly go into the Nike store and use their generous military discount.
He was just trying to follow Kap's lead, and chose to "sacrifice" his feet for the ignorance he believes in
I wonder if Liberals will run out and support their crazy freind and brand like we did with the great In and out burger ? I doubt it somehow !
Is this true? Just asking for a friend.
I havent been on twitter all day and I roll up to I was worried about what they may have done and that I may have to change my go to athletic brand just to realize that they are woke as hell and now I want MORE Nike stuff
Screw Nike what the hell where they thinking; dumbass business people. I never bought their cheap crap anyway and will tell others not to buy their junk. You just stated how much you hate America.

Seriously Enough SJW BS
Anyone burning destroying Nike anything and calling for is a racist bigot prejudiced ass and clueless to why Kap took a knee or just doesnt care why because you are Racist good job
There are folks in third world nations going barefoot, but here in the US, people are burning shoes because they got their feelings hurt.
if you want to make a display about nike - please donate your shoes to children who need them instead of burning them or destroying them! its a huge waste and there are many many kids who could use them.
Suicide bombers could say the same thing. Everyone believes in something, it's what you believe that's important.
We give new & gently used shoes and clothing to kids & the homeless. If you dont want your Nike shoes or apparel please Contact us at thejdf.org
Its literally just clothes .. its not that deep ....
Just so you know...
To all the men boycotting Nike because they are outraged over taking a knee... I hope anytime you ask a girl to go down on you, she says sorry, I thought you didnt support taking a knee.
As an Army officer with three combat deployments, I support both of them.
Their products actually dont last long because theyre put together like shit and made with shitty materials. Their products are way overpriced and overrated.
JUST F**K IT.
Anyone who backs the for using in their advertising campaign can politely go suck a chode. Youre all racist nonces.
I just bought stock on sale today! Thanks !!
He is a hypocrite. He openly supports a regime in communist Cuba but pisses on our flag? Really?
NIKE- there are so many that have given the ultimate sacrifice for their country! I may be one insignificant person to you but Colin sacrificed nothing for me I support companys that support real heros!
Just in case you were wondering...
RANDOMNESS OF THE DAY: I may be a day late and a boner short....but "Impotence day" is today. I guess? Its basically labor day for dicks. Just because
To all the haters....save your energy and focus on solving the real issue here!
Hey Nike! Im out. My kids and husband too. Rarely use twitter but its time to say goodbye to you.
No nike money is worth as much as an NFL contract and other rewards from playing. He sacrificed more than most if us ever will. I read he's had some contract with nike since 2011 so don't get your knickers in a knot.
"...hes given support to dictators and cop killers. And now, hes the new face of Nike."
Nothing really to do with sanctimonious roided-out pseudo intellectual poseurs like Kapernick, but Nike really makes a garbage product.
Damnit Nike! I just bought a ton of your clothes.
Just garbage canned my only pair of Nike shoes. They have always been uncomfortable anyway. If NIKE wants to join Kaepernick in disrespecting our flag I will not be a customer EVER!
I'm a cartoonist but I have to take a stand (or a knee) on racial, police brutality. has nothing to do with patriotism-everything to do with divisiveness.
If critics of the decision to honor were anything like the people supports, we'd be looting & burning stores tonight.
I am going to boycot something because everyone else is doing it, hurr a durr I am going to stick to the man! I want burn my own stuff xD, I am retarded xd, Someone said something I don't like xd
UNIR1 News US is out! Stories via
Anyone got size 13 Nikes they just need to get rid of? Lemme known Ill take them.
. This is what a company with an ounce of patriotism and support for law enforcement would have done verses trying to capitalize off a national division and fake narrative.
To all the people how are destroying their shoes. I understand you may not like and agree with the message of advertisement. But please give them away rather than destroy them. Theyre are too many less fortunate people who could use them more. .
Just do it and stop buying Nike. Do not give hate money.
I'll have to buy those custom shoes I created online and left in the cart
Ever wonder who made consciousness?
Don't just set YOUR Nike's on fire, set your FRIEND'S Nike's on fire. While they're wearing them. Set your computer on fire so Nike libs can't hack it. Set the world on fire so we can all burn for eternity! YOUR LORD SATAN COMMANDS IT.
So disgusted to look down after my run to see this symbol of God/flag-hating liberal tardism. I've been seeing people cut off the logos but I think I may have to amputate this leg
Doesnt mean everyone is treated equal. Taking a knee should have you listening. Not yelling and burning products because YOU with privilege is uncomfortable.
Dear , please tell us if anyone involved in the decision to use to promote products has a family member who is in the US military or law enforcement, or is a veteran, Scout leader, etc. Betting the answer is no. (Please retweet)
Hace dos a√±os que no me compro un nuevo par de tennis y los que tengo ya est√°n muy desgastados, no quemen sus tennis, mejor denmelos :(
was one of the few large companies trusted. Did they just (un)do it?
If you have size 12 Nikes you're planning to burn. You can give them to me, that way you show your disgust for Nike and you prevent me from buying Nikes. Everybody wins!
So ppl are mad TODAY over supporting someone theyre sponsored for years now? Im so confused... nothing is different than it was 7 days ago... yall are lame
Pat Tillman would have supported Kap.Just sayin'.
No never mind. You'll have to delete the tweet. I know that command delete files. I'm not an asshole like liberals who put shit out there in the so-called sneaker community. I'll expand the warning that the command deletes all files
All these morons that burn their Gear.. ! No one incl cares what you burn. They already got their $ out of you, lol. You just have less apparel so who won that battle? all you want. They have all of sports, your one pair of shoes ain't ..
or/and Whichever way you want it?? ....you are just plain WRONG....Sooo we're 'Just do it'....Boycott them....
If you really feel that strongly about it, burn your house down. Do it safely of course... Cmon patriots! Prove your love of misguided symbolism and burn your house to the ground.
What is with you apparel companies getting all political all of a sudden?? Definitely not a good business plan. Stay out of politics.
Nikes New Racist Campaign to Alienate White America. Just Do It
White people: now I have to set fire to these Nike sneakers I paid so much money for because my racism trumps everything else Lmfao yall are special but instead of burning perfectly good shit just donate to people who actually need them you bored assholes!
Im going to be Nikes more than ever, BECAUSE they do support Colin Kaepernick. They have my business.
Ok so clowns are burning their s because of ad campaign. I want to see and all other car makers sign him up for their ads! Be funny to watch the idiots crash their cars in a " boycott"
The is ridiculous. Instead of not buying Nike because they make their clothes in sweatshops we arent buying them anymore because theyre new spokesperson is someone who kneeled? Kneeling > poor labor conditions?
Instead of destroying your already paid for Nike sneakers, try donating to the tens of thousands of kids that took L's in raffles all over the world.
because I'm not going to give money to a company that thinks Colin Kaepernick sacrifices more than the police or military
Political Extremist ruined NFL, now my Nikes. Nike's message is simply EVERYTHING should be political, I will abstain from them just like I do from any other extreme Political agenda.After 40+ years of buying only NIKE, I do not know where to begin to look.Ideas?
Ive honestly been a Skechers gal for a while, but I think I just might start shopping Nike now.
People be out there burning up their only pair of sneakers.. this is our time man, slap another shoe together with and lets get going! Get on top of that shit!
coming from a company who uses child slave labor, and now supports anti American values. Karma is a bitch
At the same time so much economic overdevelopment and political underdevelopment has people (who believe themselves to be taking a social justice stance) supporting a serious multinational exploiter of the world's poor.
A company should not alienate half their customer base by dragging us through more divisive political opinions. Someone needs to be fired for the worst advertising decision ever made.
Nike is supporting Antifa...
Is it just me, or is spending $120 on shoes and then lighting them on fire because you're a racist douche nozzle pretty much the apex of human stupidity & bigotry...?
A Nike e Fo da. Ousada, criativa e improv√°vel, como devem ser as pessoas que fazem a diferen√ßa Fez o primeiro t√™nis para corredores de rua, e ainda faz o melhor. Foda-se os babacas de plantao, boicote aos imbecis
So just cause you cut off the Nike check off your clothes doesnt mean shyt you already bought the thing.. Nike Got they money out of you already .... Are you dumb or Are you stupid???
Nikes New Racist Campaign to Alienate White America. Just Do It
just became my favorite brand
. No more Nikes for my household.
As NFL offers measured response to Nikes Kaepernick ad, other reactions range from support to outrage
Bye Nike. Never again. Spent thousands over the last 25 years. Guess Ill buy from Payless now.
Dear Wannabe Activists: destroying material goods which you already own and for which you have already paid is about as effective as, well, it isn't. Just Don't Do It.
Perhaps, if who those crying foul instead listened to people of color (their own neighbors & friends) or evaluated their own internalized racism, they would come to understand the notion of is yet another brick in the wall that separates us from reigning in racism.
Need an example of how fucked up we are? We let the views of a name brand tear us apart. And the views of ONE individual separate us. Me personally? I cant stand Colin or the shit he started. But I dont hate you if you do.
Do you have to boycott everyone you dont agree with or just the ones that you disagree with the most? I stopped wearing a long time ago for a different reason. rocks!
All my life in America I pree White ppl wearing colored ppl name brand attires..strange to me cause I only shop black and small businesses.. I look at them and laugh.
BAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Are you serious?????
I dont plan on buying Nike ever again until they get rid of this deal. Newsflash... republicans probably have more money to buy these products than liberals. Thanks for letting us know your side Nike.
Nike can afford to pay millions of dollars to Colin Kaepernick because they underpay their exploited workers in third world nations Not cool.Take a stand.
There will be no Purge in this household Long live and Jordans ‚Äì at Garage Lounge!
says 'famous' ( ) defending as spokesperson. do w common people? - nuttin!
looks like and just earned millions of new customers
Just Do It!!!
if only Trump supporters thought Vladimir Putin disrespected America as much as they think Colin Kaepernick did
Wait Im so confused...what happened with Nike???
Anybody with Nike gear burning it should be ashamed. There are poor people that could use those shoes.
our flag and National Anthem must be respected as it stands as a symbol of our great nation. I will destroy all My Nike items and never buy the brand again.
Purchased today. No interest in supporting
just lost my families business forever. Kaepeenick does not represent my values nor most people I know. should be ashamed for doing business with them. Just bought a pair of trail runners.
Wild how people are burning their gear b/c of a show of support for Colin Kaepernick but dont care the clothes/shoes are made by children in sweat shops. So which is worse?
Goodbye you just lost a lifelong customer
Nike signing Colin Kaepernick: trends, stock slips over 'Just Do It' campaign and I'll also join the .
Lebron James Williams, would never support NIKE if they wern't PAID. WAKE UP AMERICA ITS ALL $$$$ for them an even Kapernick, not support of cause.
Your Move Conservatives, do you (1) Leave them alone and look like you support Nike(2) Burn them and appear to hate America
Nike signing Colin Kaepernick: trends, stock slips over 'Just Do It' campaign and I'll also join the .
I wish the fuck I would burn anything I bought from a company. Even if their in the wrong, I paid for the shit and I dont burn my money. Would I do business with them again is the real question.
I just smashed my 70" 4K TV so i wouldnt have to see the Nike ad. Guess I owned those Libs!!
I 'used' to like to run marathons in my ...
I seriously need to know. .
ok look i understand you have your priorities with the boycott and i somewhat agree, but why would you burn those shoes, that shits expensive. plus there are better ways to grt rid of your nike stuff, like donating it to charity...
did not sacrifice anything. He was 3rd string & done. He is not MLK. must be insane to involve politics in their product. People get shot for their shoes. Get your facts straight
Birds of a feather flock together! wears socks depicting cops as pigs! was running CHILD LABOR SWEATSHOPS out of and !and to think is "PROUD" to be a supporter of !
everyone who has pride for out country and flag should boycott Nike. I do not support a company that hires a spokesperson who takes a knee to our flag.
Nahh, is just branching out into pig cops socks and had to get someone that represents.
Birds of a feather flock together! wears socks depicting cops as pigs! was running CHILD LABOR SWEATSHOPS out of and !and to think is "PROUD" to be a supporter of !
Support TRUMP 2020, stand for the flag and protect America.
is not about racism it is about supporting our country, our troops, and our police! We should all boycott Nike until they decide that trying to put a racial divide in America just to put dollars in their pockets is not a good move.
Good evening!For those outraged by the fact that Colin Kaepernick is now a face of Nike's 30th Anniversary "Just Do It" campaign: instead of cutting holes in your clothes on social media, consider donating them. (Just a reminder that Nike already has your money)
Man all I own are shoes, stop making everything political hell next we will be boycotting Skippy peanut butter. If you disagree with their ideals don't promote them by talking about them, don't burn your shoes donate them. They are just shoes guy
Just wondering, is the director of marketing still employed?
Dear Offended,Why not do something positive with your Just a suggestion.
-other players that have done way worse & have played again after time off because their skill was more important 2 coaches then hassle they got 2 let them play SO perhaps no coach cares enough its just that simple that colins skills are not worth the hassle
Americans going mental again. Usually over their anthems/flags/guns. Mixture of two of them this time.
shares down today on endorsement news which is strange because all of these folks are going to need new Nike's when they forget about this in 2 weeks
What's up with americans always burning shit once the thing they once loved turns on them. I mean, why not just walk away from it or throw it away, why always set it on fire?
I had 2 pair of shoes saved in my cart when I saw this news (was waiting to use on 9/5). I've got 3 pair of and 4 pair of saved now. We'll donate our old Nikes to a shelter. In my house we & our .
This is in no way related to the , its just straight facts.
You're acting like most people are buying... I'm not. But, but not because of some douchebag with a huge fro.
america be like: just because a black man who spoke out against police brutality is in an ad not because of the child labor that goes into making the sneakers youre burning
Just did it..no more
Nike sells u expensive shoes that arent made in the US
La gente que est√° a favor del es subnormal, a parte de racista, aunque eso ya se entiende sabiendo que el boycott es por iniciar una campa√±a con un jugador que desafi√≥ el patriotismo de USA y dejo en evidencia su racismo
Seriously!! What were you thinking? How about someone who is honorable and shows respect for America. You may have stepped in it - or not!
I guess I will no longer be a Nike customer.
If you're burning stuff or partaking in the in any way because a guy's face is on a picture and pretending it's about "tHe tRooPz" you are a hilariously dangerous level of idiotic.
you know what would be amazing if & others all took a stand and applauded or even liked the colin kaepernick ad. you wont lose by supporting. you will take away the power of hate.
My fav track shoes WERE my Nikes. But I cannot countenance wearing them again, ever, because of what that company says in exalting a racist who professes his hatred so publicly He is not a HERO!
Just Block it!
With / trending all day because of ... stock was down, as was Adidas & Puma. New Balance is an American company but doesn't trade publicly. DOES and its stock price today.
If youre cutting the swooshes off of your stuff, send them to me and Ill see them on my clothes. I wanna support them, but Im broke.
Stone cold, lead pipe analysis: the fake patriots burning their $200 Nike shoes are not the same people being assaulted by cops.
not because of the new campaign but because you should buy American made products
Since I am seriously thinking about getting back to playing soccer...do they still make the Nike Total 90s?
ANYONE WITH THE JORDAN 3 GOLF SHOES , if you hate Nike and dont want them anymore size 11.5 could wear 11s as well, if you dont want them dont burn them bc they are beautiful I just added the tag to get my message out not against cap
Just do it fren

I'm buying Nike gear because of this decision. And screw all the people.
In solidarity with the movement, I will be wearing these on the J train this evening.
If you want to burn your Nikes just give them to me!!!Shit I'll donate them to all those veterans you care so much about!! <-- LOL like this is the worst thing they've done
Grande estrat√©gia da Nike. Enfurece os apoiantes do Dr. Trump e estes correm para as lojas para comprarem artigos para queimarem. Oportunidade de mercado no segmento '√ìdio', pico de vendas e hip√≥tese zero de pessoas feias usarem Nike. √âMercadoLivreNoSeuEsplendor
. My LAST Nike product has been purchased. I am so mad that businesses can't stay out of politics. You don't have to do it. You want to, therefore, I out!
Can we all just take a minute to appreciate journalist Tim Pool's inability to pronounce famous names and brands?
Went straight home and hit myself in the face with my air maxs until my nose broke to show Nike we mean business
....I am not a business major but I always thought the main objective of any business was to increase profit and market share. So why would Nike incorporate an add campaign that will alienate a good portion of NFL fans half the population?
Just dump Nike traitors
Everyone burning their Nike shoes and cutting up socks are naively falling into a marketing trap carefully researched by a multi-billion dollar company that did its homework.Nike profits off of stupid people and social justice, while losing absolutely nothing.
This so called is ridiculously and if you think you are hurting the company by destroying the apparel you bought for my then your Crazy and you arent hurting thing then you are helping them!!
s√≥lo es justificable por el hecho de usar a un terrible QB para promocionarse. Cu√°nta urgencia por hacerse notar.
I'm just glad to be born in a time where the biggest social issue is not a war, a plague or famine, but rather a shoe company advertising someone you don't like.
This is easily the best one so far, all these fake assholes with their would rather waste something good than put it to good use cause they think its patriotic
gotta say as long as colin k is the face of ill never spend another penny on products i dont hate him just find him pathetic really
Well, when Marie Tillman, Pat's wife, says that Pat would be the first to kneel, boy that shoots in the ass all your "Nike should use Tillman" bullcrap arguments.
POTUS Finally Responds To Nikes Kaepernick Ad Campaign In True Trump Fashion, And It Will Make You Sick
Kapernick Has NEVER sacrificed anything near what the men and women of the US Military and Law Enforcement has.
Hey welcome to ! Supporting take a knee... ? Really? Slap in the face to me and out . Upperhand for and others
While we are at it might as well start kicking people out of sporting venues that sit or do not take off their hats during the national anthem while we are at it. Now that has been going on for years before this whole Kaepernick issue just my 2 cents
If Ive learnt anything new today its if you want to boycott a company. ‚ÄòJust do it by using the product youve already bought and paid for then burn it. Thatll show um They will be in liquidation before they know it
Yeah before you go burning your Nikes HMU cause I know how you Bonham white people are....
If you are participating in the dont burn/trash your gear! Donate it to people who could really use it!
A call to boycott Nike, using the hashtag , has been trending this morning on Twitter, but there seems to be more people defending Nikes decision than attacking them for it.
Just in case Brick shows his cowardice, screenshot. donated more than you have in your life, but you're too busy toting the bigot line you had no idea how much he'd done
They disrupt, scream and cry...but at the end of the day, America WINS....and they wonder why? This is OUR country..and, through hell or high-water, were gonna keep it GREAT!
Must be nice to benefit from white privilege . Move to Russia if you don't believe in the 1st ammendment.
First Nike and Kaep. then Netflix releases Black Panther I know you guys are big mad appalled, upset, insulted (insert whatever word your little insignificant racist heart conjures up) but Nike was okay when they backed tigers community penis having ass FOH!!!
needs to stay out of GROWN FOLKS business. Congrats
Just burned my OVO Jordans! Take that Nike!
The new nike image. Another big business failure. Unbelievable corporate idiots.
I disagree with the for the same reason I disagree with the .Its always the lower-wage workers trying to support their families who get hurt the most.Of course I prefer anyway. So theres that.
wheres that same energy when we heard those kids getting raped by PA priest???
Just uh...gonna say one thing for y'all You're a bunch of dumbasses and Nike is barely going to feel a thing because people love NikeGo on and burn your quality shoes instead of idunno, donating them to people who'll appreciate it more
Just Do It
Just throwing this out there...If youre feeling upset with NIKE, I wear a Medium in mens shirts, shorts/pants, and a 8.5 shoe.
This is hilarious. Thats all fine and dandy, yall, but now who has to go buy themselves new socks and sneakers WHO IS THE REAL WINNER HERE? It aint I gotta go buy me some new sneaks now man. Hes just out another $50-$100+!!
Corporate America is at war with the American people. Don't burn their foreign made garbage, JUST STOP BUYING IT!!!THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES FOR EVERYTHING.
2/2 Oh yes,and don't forget to burn your house! Bcuz none of those things could exist without 6 white stripes, 7 red stripes, and a hell of a lot of stars!
Why are these people burning sneakers theyve already paid for instead of giving them to charities that support the military? Hey, you dumb fucks, you already paid for these shows, Nike already has your money!
They have to be seen to burn the latest stuff. Can't burn old stuff! Must buy new! Then burn! Is there one brain cell that they all share? Do they pass it around & lay inert in a darkened room when they haven't got it? I think in the UK share one too.
not only will I not buy anything with the Nike brand, I am throwing away all of the Nike clothing I have. How dare you make someone who disgraced our country be the face of your brand? You are going to lose billions of dollars and deserve every bit of it.
When you just bought a brand new pair of all white Nike Air Force 1s, but now you have to burn them
I can fully support the ad campaign featuring while at the same time questioning their labor practices. Civil disobedience should be celebrated in a world gone violently amuck.
The Catholic Church has been systematically fucking little kids and covering it up, but sure, because of Kaepernick makes sense
Nike signing Colin Kaepernick: trends, stock slips over 'Just Do It' campaign and I'll also join the .
I just saved Nikes stock symbol so i can watch it plummet real time.

Im mad Nike using Colin Kapernick as LIBERAL propaganda Time to go in my closet and burn all of my nike stuff Nice try Hilary but I outsmarted you
I hope Nike and Kaepernick because people are awake & waking up. We see what their agenda is really about.Money & Fame.
Russia Says Space Station Leak May Be Deliberate Sabotage pointy end of the logo made the hole.
Republicans idea of boycotting always involves buying the product they dont like. Just like when they were buying Starbucks to show them whos boss lol. I guarantee morons are out there buying new nike shit just to burn it for RTs and Facebook likes
Hey if yall need someone to help burn your size 6 Romaleo 2s, I got you. Just send them my way
is the most stupid company & definitely not made in the USA They have a suicide death wish. And I say bring it on
Just saying, all this hatred surrounding movements like could so easily be resolved if these people watched
Don't worry ! I usually buy Adidas, but I will replace one of these misunderstanding people and switch to a brand supporting social justice.
I feel like the out there burning Nikes are probably the same people who would be burning crosses if they could get away with it .These people are just using patriotism as an excuse to justify their racism.
I have been an investor and faithful Nike customer for 49 years. Today I sold my Nike Stock. I wont wear any of my Nike apparel until they remove Kaepernick as the face of their company.
Burning trainers because you dislike the whole kneeling thing from ? What?! But hes doing it in the name of equality and justice. Is that so bad?

Just a reminder.....good guys wear
Hey ! If Trump's wall gets built just put lots of your logos on it and then it'll get destroyed by confused racists.
Everyone going on about why not talk about black on black violence which kills thousands more black peoples than the cops do.
better start selling cookies or food outside of university games, because you won't be able to support oregon university athletics they way your headed..
David, I am very conflicted. Nike makes its shoes in sweatshops using children. Not sure which side to go with.
The spirit that drives one person to burn a pair of already purchased Nikes is the same spirit that might move another person to buy the branded apparel thats part of Kaepernicks endorsement with the company. lol
Can yall please push out the merch since people out here burning apparel. Thank you for not staying silent on this issue!! GOATS lead by example!!!
Burning Nikes is stupid just like kneeling during the anthem
I dont like it when companies jumps into political issues like Nike just did. Such decisions are not made in a vacuum so they knew this would shake things up. Time to .
The fact that Colin Kaepernick is the new face of Nike offers me the perfect excuse to buy a new pair of sneakers.
Explaining why signing Colin Kaepernick was a poor decision for business by Nike..
must be proud endorsing along these noted Social Justice Warriors: terrorist supporter & anti-semite and Communist apparatchik .
I love white people.... And then continuous ignorance! How about you be a leader and inspire.
No. has more people talking about their brand than they've had in a long while. Goes beyond the US, the things stands for transcend international boundaries - a few angry Americans are outweighed by a world that believes in equality.
Bogus . Whuudup ?
Nike just blow it with Kaepernick ad?
And for all you sneakerhead Nike boycotters, Jordan Brand a subsidiary of Nike so make sure you let them exclusives and non GRs sit on the shelves tooGive me a better chance at coppin what I want when I want
No more Nike in our house.
How hilarious would it be if responded to peoples tweets of burning and dismembering their product with ...no returns.
They used to burn crosses. Now it's Nikes.
Okay people say the has to do with being black. People I have 2 words for you MICHAEL JORDAN!! We are boycotting Nike, because they support someone who support anti American ideas. Like targeting our police.
damn, I just wanted to buy shoes this evening :/ well I guess I just don't do it :P I don't want my shoes to be controversial :P
Dus ik moet nu ongeveer nieuwe schoenen kopen?
Nike shares fall as Colin Kaepernick's 'Just Do It' ad divides America via
This is what the ad should have looked like you dinguses!
People that burn their Nikes are the same people that burn crosses.
Here's an idea! If you are upset with because of Kaepernick ad, instead of destroying merchandise you already spent your money on, DONATE IT! There are plenty of folks, including homeless who would appreciate it!
I support the . I'm hoping for an , too. And a , , , , and . Someone please buy some gear so I can unload my $40 class A's.
Ppl that are 'outraged' are saying everything under the sun except "I'm racist, that's what I'm really mad at" . kneeling was actually a sign of respect & despair to a flag & anthem that used to mean a lot more to ppl, he deserves praise
Oh what to do ..... thisll confuse them ....
Por qu√© los seguidores de est√°n quemando sus v√≠a
What if I told you that everyone's laughing at white people for boycotting Nike, are being laughed at for not boycotting the NFL, because they didn't want Kaepernick in the league but they're supporting Nike, which is the brand for the NFL jerseys?
Arent the people burning Nike stuff the same ones calling liberals weak snowflakes?
Im big confused about this whole
This is how Social Justice Warriors operate = Hypocrisy at best.
Just like a lefty, asking for a handout.
TFW a movie from 1999 throws shade at Twitter users in 2018
How about all you boycotting Nike over the perceived injustice to veterans, donate all your gear to veterans in need instead of burning it?
Just so you know
Hey : " I said give me two pair (cause) I need two pairSo I can get to stomping in my air force ones(Big boys) stomping in my air force ones." Via TSR.
Just like the players who wont quit the nfl because of the rules your not going to throw out your Nike gear
Lmao at all of the snowflakes cuting the Nike logo out of their clothes. At least when I get triggered it because yall are ignoring racial and gender equality.
I must say I'm stunned by the absorbency of a pair of shoes. They can soak up almost an entire can of lighter fluid. Needless to say, I've gotten a lot of deaths up here in the last 24 hours.

Trump supporters will be broke, naked, and starving after this presidency. They seem to have a knack of burning everything around them.
im a size 8 in shoes, stop burning them and just mail them to me
Just going to leave this here. But, let's be honest we all know they will be buying new Nikes in a couple of weeks, just like they did with their Keurigs.
If people actually read the news most markets are down because of the UNESSESARY TRADE WAR. TARRIFS are taxes people. I'm going to my local Nike shoe store and buying a pair soon.
I sure hope those of us that can reasonably decipher between the simple American foundations of what is good and what is bad are ready for whatever realm those promoting the are going to be crawling out from.
I wonder if as many Nike products were defaced in light of the worker exploitation the company built itself on , or is Kaepernick's suggestion of racial justice in America the only step taken too far?
Instead of burning or cutting up your Nike apparel, just use a sharpie!
Just went to see if my gym sneakers are Nikes. They are. For a minute I there I thought I'd have to buy a new pair of sneakers.
To all the ppl who want to burn their Nike clothes/Shoes/Soccer cleats, because they are racist, or some other American virtue, send me your Nike gear. I will gladly accept Size Md/Lg shirts and shorts/pants, and size 11-11.5 shoes and soccer cleats
For all of those who are boycotting Nike, can you please stop telling us about it and Just Do it??
Lol - tanks their stock - because of - hahahhaha! A bunch of fools.
- Hates oppression by US police, so he gets in bed with a mega-company that profits by running oppressive shops around the globe. Furthermore, this company preys on primarily the poor, charging $200 per pair to kids on welfare.
Trump supporters were meeting up to bash Nike.
So after reading all the division a multinational company choseing a former NFL QB who got benched for something called a Blaine Gabbert causes all I have to say is please bring on the nukes.
To all my fellow white people, stop it. You are embarrassing all of us. You are making us all look stupid. Burning your gear doesn't hurt anyone but you. already has your money. They don't care what you do with the stuff now.
Wonder if the threat of a is gonna really hurt . I curious if the stock is gonna continue to
Combustible? or non-combustible?
players kneel & explain in detail that they love the USA, but can't stand for a song that's racist: pro-slavery & white superiority. Wht ppl insist that players HATE AMERICA & that's what sticks. WHITE SUPREMACY!!
If Nike have anything about them their next commercial, preferably during the , will consist of Colin Kaepernick shitting on an American flag durin the national anthem, then walking off leaving a shit in the shape of a Nike tick, "Just Poo It" then appears!
It amazes me how someone who is rebellious against the Flag and our Anthem sure likes to use it to his advantage.
This whole thing is quite ridiculous.
This is what Nike and Krapperdick support.
/ Nike used to be my biz account, extremely left lib biased, its all about Profit! MILLENNIUMS are like rats scurrying around Campus! Yet, with CK it may backfire on Nike!I quit / years ago!! and "COLIN A ROYAL FLUSH"
is just another washed up, irrelevant NFL thug.
If I had my nikes on I'd probably praise them for goading such dafties. I'll just praise my under armours instead.
I stopped watching the NFL. Now I will stop buying Nike products. Come on Nike, love your country, support our national anthem. Or your company will face bad financial times ahead.
Donald Don't Grab That Pussy teaches kids to pet animals correctly.
This situation just goes to show that many white Americans feel America belongs to them and anyone else simply needs to be grateful.
I just want to know why these big companies don't use veterans, as the face of their products, people that have fought and lost in sacrificed way more than any of us ever will. And it would have a hell of a lot more meaning.
Just screw it! Hello Under Armour goodbye Nike! Adios from my family.......
Burning shoes and cutting of Nike apparel all because they chose . Go ahead and waste you money. is not hurting at all.
lost about $3.75 billion in market cap after announcing quarterback as the new face of its Just Do It ad campaign. Shares of NKE stock dropped about 4 percent on Tuesday morning, as has been trending on Twitter:
I truly hope Kaepernick and Nike fail as they learn a valuable lesson from this fiasco, those of us who fought for this country don't want to see this kind of BS mixed with sports. Kaepernick didn't NOTHING during the off season to help. Nike has offended patriots!
when you hear people are doing the instead of talking about why domestic abusers and racists are still allowed to be police officers...
Wonder how many of these folks that support the thought about boycotting the Catholic Church over 1,000+ children being molested and the church covering it up...
Just think of all the Nike stuff we warrior's now have to throw away! Lol
Trust me, Donald Trump and all his stooges will be gone/forgotten soon and Nike will be just fine!!
GOOD - I have a feeling this is just the "beginning" of the losses they are going to suffer. They've turned their backs on MOST of the country, our military, MN&WMN in blue, ICE agents and Conservative Americans who will not be spending their hard earned money on
If you burned your Nikes just remember you already purchased them. has your money. So by the time you need another pair of kicks this whole fiasco won't be trending anymore...duh!
what earner all them are how did they afford all that money burn people normally get mugged & ‚Å¥√° pair ! These idiots just walk in store & mugged themselves by of ‚Å¥NS
Boycotting companies for anything other than quality/price is stupid. If a company offers a good product, they have my business. If they don't, they don't have my business. It's that simple.
Its already started! Not too difficult to understand, but then again, they can't figure out what bathroom to use.
Would really love to see all these white patriots, burning and destroying their Nikes, actually give them to a homeless Vet whose sacrifice they so vigorously claim to honor and defend.
As NFL offers measured response to Nikes Kaepernick ad, other reactions range from support to outrage
Guess what Im gonna do with my shoes (these are only a few)??? Wear them!!! Go Ill buy more this week in support of American injustice - Im Native American so I know a few things about the subject.

You burning the shoes is just damaging our planet, think about what you do
Yes!! This!! People are just stupid for burning a pair of shoes! Seriously?! Grow up!
If you want 2 hear from assh*les just fart
Too bad people didn't care as much in 2011, when teamed up with & to award a vicious dog killer "sportsman of the year". Just so we're all clear, slamming a dog on the ground over & over until it dies is ok with & all its customers.
Lets be honest here: isn't 'honoring' , they are intentionally stoking the embers of a divisive issue to try to sell ... It's pathetic and it isn't working.
Oh and btw, you crazies out there burning and cutting Nike clothes. Go hard or go home, yall better burn your converse, burn your Hurley gear, burn Cole Haan items etc. Cause Nike owns them too...Know your stuff.
got , the face of told POTUS hes not going to the White House no more, made Jay-Z ambassador and he supports Kapernick, and got Kapernick supporters on they payroll! So what exactly are ya'll white people gonna wear?
So Nike is supporting kneeling during the national anthem, which dishonors the hundreds of thousands who gave their lives for this country, sounds like a good time to wear some adidas!
You can call the whatever you want, i personally call it the a bunch of grown ass adults crying and burning their stuff because the face of the company has a different view than you do. Man what a time
Hey sports fans! If you're considering boycotting over their use of a football player that you don't like, but didn't feel the need to do so when we found out Nike uses child labor, you might want to re-evaluate your priorities.
hilarious how these people with a collective IQ of 5 are now stock experts. Probably dont even know what a brokerage account is.
Nike just basically secured the entire black community‚Äòs money! embraced MJ, embraced Tiger embraced williams sisters... nike with smart business moves since day one, they know what they doin!
is DESPICABLE! Just went to the nike outlet and bought 4 pairs to take home and burn!
just made a colossal marketing faux pax by supporting a political controversy. Theyve now pissed ON - and pissed OFF - over 50% of their customer base. Nice... nice... really smart (sarcasm intended).
Shopping with my mom and got me and her a pair of sneakers. Ironically there was a shopping too and so I got him a . You can and support and the too!! And yes I also still support lol
and yet we have pieces of shit like colin kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem, and even worse companies like supporting this egregious behavior.
The faces of Nike are Lebron James , Serena Williams and Colin Kaepernick.The face of Under Armour, Steph Curry.Addidas several artists openly Support Kaepernicks message/movement.Puma has Jay-ZMight wanna get with Aasics
Stop using the troops as an excuse to burn your Nike shit. Im not your scapegoat. Im gonna sit over here and continue to buy my Nike stuff, they give military a discount
This is incredibly stupid, Y'all. Just thought you should know.
I once boycotted a chicken place because they employed cows, but come on, those cows were never going to get latex gloves over their hooves. Sanitation people.
The point of the is not to be remembered in history. It's point is to cause an effect in the here and now or send a message.
I've seen a lot of ridiculous photos and videos of idiots burning their Nike stuff, but this one is by far the funniest one. What an idiot! And why the fuck is the anthem playing in the background?
Its not a game if yall supporting this so called my family will be more than happy to take them Nikes off of your hands.
I guess sacrificing everything  doesnt include grassroots work on the streets of ? Just time grandstanding.
Wrong is what happens when Nike backs an a$$hole. I know this is inconvenient to hear but things aren't always because of racism or sexism. Sometimes people like Colin Kaepernick are not liked simply because they're jerks.
Also, I just love the fact that I can wear some fresh Nikes and receive the added benefit of pissing off some old Conservatives(Oh yea, military gets like 10% off, fyi if some of yall change ya minds)
SWOOSH NOW Synonymous ANTI POLICE & ANTI Military You wear the SWOOSH WE KNOW WHERE YOU STAND! Anti AMERICAN. NFL just signed contact for ALL NFL PLAYERS TO WEAR THE SWOOSH.
! How stupid could Nike be? They want to put that face of a man that disrespects the national anthem on their slogan forJust do it...... if you have any Nike shares you better sell them now!
spit on veterans sacrifices! Way to support our veterans! I can't tell you how angry this whole subject makes me! Disappointed!
All you folk kicking off with are totally half-arsing this over . I haven't just burnt my stuff, I've burnt EVERYTHING with so-much as a TICK on it... and one aerosol explosion later, my house is on fire and my wife is dead!
On croit avoir toucher le fond... Puis il y a les am√©ricains et leur lobbying sans valeur avec leur fausse pudeur puritaine... Puis on se dit que finalement la terre tourne toujours. Bravo
So whos supporting this I wear a size 12 in all Dunks, Kobe, and KD 11.5 in Foams, Lebrons 11-11.5 in Jordans, my wife wears a 7 in kids, my daughter wears a 5.5-6 and my youngest daughter wears a 2 well be more than happy to take em off your hands.
Today in : People who purport to "support" homeless and impoverished veterans light fire to useable, already paid for merchandise. Instead of, you knowdonating it to homeless or impoverished vets? is as much of a joke as their logic
Burning shoes you've bought with your own money just seems... stupid & pretty fuckin pointless. You already gave your money, so now your dumb ass is out a pair of shoes. It ain't even that damn deep.
You Just Did It!
I tend to base my dislike with a company based on REAL LIFE PROBLEMS...such as the shoes don't fit my feet well, their shirts aren't sized well, or the clothes don't last long. NEVER HAVE I EVER boycotted a company because they employ a black man.
This is a wonderful idea. Just DO it. I would if I owned anything made by , but I dont.
Sacrifice Is Serving Others Not Yourself. People sacrifice and help change lives every day without making a fuss or being recognized OR sometimes with no Pay..glad I dont buy
Wasnt it just last week that conservatives were making fun of liberals for boycotting a company because the company donated money to a cause that the liberals disagreed with? I guess its only ridiculous when liberals do it.
Coming from someone who colored the US flag wrong Im a proud Nike user and I will continue to wear Nike no matter what, this whole is stupid.
Wheres twitter at for this? Keep that same energy
People shouldn't burn their own shoes. wants to reach the urban market, which already shoplifts their Nike shoes, so ppl should do the same. Shoplift shoes then burn them! Then Nike will be losing money twice as fast!
One main thing Ive learned from this whole ridiculous garbage is that Americans think Nike is only on sale in America...newsflash there is a big bad world outside of the US and guess which side of the argument the majority fall on... hint its not the racist one.
Tomorrow Nike Inc. Stock will open lower then closing as investors who were waiting to see which way the wind blows sell trying to get out before the bottom drops out, causing the bottom to drop out. Short it!
Getting in on this simply so that Nike gets even more exposure.Y'all thinking you're patriotic when burning Nike attire you already paid for instead of donating to people in need in your country. All because of an (important) ad. Get yo head outta yo asses.
The real definition of being extremely dumb... like Im going to burn my own Nike stuff bought with my own cash because Nike is supporting someone or a cause that Im not supporting
The same people that are say they're for the are the same people trashing my store and asking for sizes
People are wild out here, burning shoes and clothes because the brand chose a quarterback that took a knee during the National Anthem, to promote something. Kids and homeless people are out here that dont have clothes or shoes; you guys do stuff like this...smh
Gotta give some cred to that. Watch now all the people hating the because of Kaepernick, will now be because Nike is a tennant of Trump and paying Trump probably more money than they are paying Kaepernick.
Went out to buy Nikes for my whole damn family just because!
1/2 burn the flag if u must,but before you do,u better burn a few other things!U better burn your shirt and your pants! Be sure to burn your TV and car!
Sorry yall, but all the people who are burning their Nike gear...yall arent really do anything to Nike because you paid for that stuff already. Youre merely burning $100+ worth of stuff that you bought and PAID for already.
if you have windows 95 on ur computer, if you are using cds to access the internet, if you have a cord on your house phone...you probably still are wearing British knights so aint worried about u
So you don't have a problem with a shoe company using sweat shops, paying pennies to Indian and Chinese children to make their shoes, but God forbid a black man who is shedding light on injustice in America is on an ad fuck you hillbillies
Maybe if Kap became the spokesman for inbreeding the future of civilization just might have a shot.
If you're going to have a you can't wear Converse either because Nike owns Converse. So good luck with that dummies.
oH Nike support slave labor in Asia
For me, its just the opposite. I dont donate garbage. When I give, I dont give whats worn out, out of style or second best. Therefore, Id be happy to buy a veteran in need some !
Y'all remember when they asked random supporters if they supported bombing Agrabah (The fictional city in Alladin) . Yea..those the same niggas burning those Runners
there are shelters than use your political agenda. Donate stuff.
This whole thing is honestly SUPER RIDICULOUS. Yall need to grow up and get over it.
Trump today said "And Nike is one of my tenants, they pay alot of money". 45 just set the trap, the Libs/Left will be picketing Nike in 3...2....1
Are yall so upset that Nike supports Kap or are yall upset that Nike has supported Kap this whole time and yall didnt know?
it so sad ppl would rather damage and destroy the the things they pay for versus helping those that can't yall want it to be about hate because that's what yall built from
I will never buy another Nike product.. apparently they have stupid people running the company ergo they must have an inferior product along with an inferior face who they chose to have as their spoke person... really!!! Dump Nike!!
fired from his job i guess you dont follow the NFL or must not know much at all about this situationtake a seat sis dont embarrass yourself even more than you already did in this tweet alone..
Given his previous performances on the seperate topics, I cant wait to se see what Dave Chapelle does with the deal
NB isn't just for New Balance it's my shoe!
When you're so ideologically driven that you support a massive company like , and you forget how they treat their workers overseas.
If you don't support liberals and Nike, you are a racist.If you do support Kaepernick you are anti-American.To both, I say your wrong. Support 4 or against Kaep is simply how you interpret his actions. Doesn't make you anti-American or a racist.Grow up people!
Would love to see a manufacturer design a sneaker with the flag, or some variation & the number 45 on the back with DJT or POTUS somewhere. Retail is $45 - proceeds go to wounded warriors or other veteran charities. Ill buy 2 pairs. . Plz RT
NB isn't just for New Balance it's my shoe!
Everybody who wears a medium and doesnt support Nike send me your items, Im gonna stream the worlds largest Nike burning
So all the liberals are freaking out that police supporters are choosing to not support Nike by boycotting and few are destroying their own property.... Can we please roll some clips of liberals burning the city down?
The most American thing I can think of is a multinational corporation based off the exploitation of impoverished peoples labor (children included) taking a political stance against injustice and having people think its a genuinely sincere sentiment.
If you are planning on throwing away unboxed or boxed mens Air Jordans or any shoes size US 8. just let me know and I will take care of them for you .
Why have businesses not all learned the adage of "get woke, go broke" yet? There are countless examples of businesses losing money as a result of adopting Progressivism but they just keep doing it. Why don't they see the trend?
This thing is ironic. Why destroy something you already paid for? Just give the gear to someone less fortunate who could use it. Its like wanting to fight poverty by donating to rich politicians because they say theyd help poor people. Youre all missing the mark.
Nike uses someone who stood up for injustice in a campaignWhite people: *Go apeshit!*Nike uses child labour to make one of the most recognizable brand in the worldWhite people: *crickets*
Only Trump supporters wld burn their shoes while still wearing them
I love the people threatening to burn their shoes/gear, as though they already didn't have their money. The is hilarious.I'm happy to stick to my Vans.
and the Whitehouse have turned every honest agency and individual into a liar just to legitimize a shady, sociopathic, narcissistic degenerate, who spent his life serving himself.
My hasband may want a because I have too many, but I just ordered another pair.

NFL releases statement in its attempt to keep both sides happy. . Only dialogue Ive seen is pointing fingers at everyone else. Police, and justice system. Time fingers are point elsewhere. .
What about all the jerseys and shoes and merch people burned multiple times throughout multiple years? Same goes with many more sport fans.
Seems like Nike and it's Colin Kaepernick ad is doing just fine despite the MAGA call for a
Even tho its fun to make fun of He isnt stupid. We all know he didnt just wake up and just all the sudden out of nowhere used him. Its all about & division.
A disgrace to our country and our military.
How supporters of the sound
And the most obviously racist hashtag of the year goes to:
These companies just never learn ... until they've lost billions. Their board of trustees is certainly taking notice.
obviously has lost touch with American consumers.
's top competitiors. Just Say NO To Nike and !
This is your 20 min warning! Tonight on - on also Gen. on crisis. Plus and join us to talk
Nike air VAPORMAX PLUS! I got the hook up on shoes. Let me know if you like! Inbox me for details.
Too bad, those boycotting Nike would get further using their shoes
The racists are coming out of the wood work calling for a because they got Colin Kaepernick as their one of their brand ambassadors. Man that justifies my next Jordan and Nike purchases. I will feel so woke while buying my next pair
The best part about the is that some MAGA supporter is gonna step on ya deadstocks this weekend u gonna do Nothing about it but run your mouth
Im tryna find the Nike Air Force 1 swoosh pack size 7y if any white folks tryna sell them because of the lemme kno
Like half of America, Im finished with Looking for new workout gear. Who wants my business? ??
You are as great as you think... yourself to be!!! Thank you to Nike for standing by us when we needed you most!!!
although it is an oversight to sign a player that had pig police officer socks on-it seems only in this day and age that humanity will boycott a brand because of a players views on gaining equality, but not because they have a history of child labor and sweatshops.
Loving this , I just might get a shot at winning those damn raffles. by all means, proceed with the boycott
No Nike products in this house!
This family will no longer purchase any clothing or equipment. Maybe you should just come out and condone Colin's anti police mentality because that is what this is all about
Kaepernick hates cops & says the American Flag and National Anthem are offensive. Every time you buy ANYTHING from , you support Kaepernick. I think that's reason enough to BUY
What if I told you, Colin Kaepernick could have started the national conversation surrounding oppression/criminal justice AND he could still be playing in the league? Think about it before arguing it...
When you assume people are racist because they stand up for what they believe in while comparing burning shoes to burning crosses.
This is why we stand for our anthem for every man & woman that served our country. They truly believe in something and many sacrificed everything
Just saying!
There is a common theme I am noticing in regards to everyone that is pushing the movement...take a wild guess on what that common theme is
pretty much just rockin Nikes... -Neal Riggers
All this talk of plummeting sales. Only cause they are sold out. If anyone can find me a pair of Monarch Red/Black UK size 8.5 normal width I'll buy them.
I have been wearing Nike products for the past 15 years, bought Nike sneakers/clothing for my son his whole childhood... and I am done! I will give my business to Reebok, Addidas... Kapernick is a spoiled brat who has NO idea what it is to be oppressed!
The NFL says "The social justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised deserve our attention and action." But they won't say what the issues are or propose action.
Disgusting!
I buy over because of switched for this reason
Regrann from - jamesjeffersonj People are burning their shoes because of a Ad... -

Also hey unoriginal commentary but uh if any of you have like size 8 or 9 men's or 11 women's shoes you're looking to destroy. . .i got callouses on my feet that tend to eat through sneakers real fast, so hmu
Here's Nike's stock over the past 5 years. They're doin' just fine.
Instead of how about ? Just picked these up for my 6 yo.
Dear white folks...stop burning your Nike staff...send them my way instead ...I can give them good use.
I am, but also at the hypocritical side lining up to pay Nike. Solidarity against oppression/injustice by paying Kaepernick millions to be the face of a marketing campaign for clothing and shoes made on the backs of foreign laborers facing actual oppression/injustice
is legitimate.... It's not just white people who defended this country, there are black soldiers, latino and various other races who make up the Army of the USA.. When they defend this country they did it selflessly so please show respect for the country.
As a veteran, at no point have i felt like was disrespecting me or my civil liberties. However, on many occasions I've felt like the color of my skin has been cause for me to be stopped or followed or profiled.
Uh just a reminder for you folks and your misguided outrage, unconscious biases, prejudices, and racism. originally took a knee at the suggestion of Green Beret who says he would do it all again!
If and were serious about addressing , he should only get paid what workers in their factories make. Cmon !
So is just the black
Love this by . Just dont understand American society.
Punish Nike for supporting this Police bashing loser.
Not only a terrible idea: 's use of hypocrite Marxist Leninist as the face of the company is an affront to all Americans.
Factory workers (which are 80% female)are making 's for 20 cents an hour and working 70 to 80 hours a week, so NIKE can profit enough to pay millions to speak out against Oppression and Injustice?
Happy to make purchases from Nine Line Apparel and support and take part in .
Youve already supported Nike by purchasing the same clothing/accessories youre destroying. What point are you really making? Just send all the merch my way!
Trump doesnt agree but doesnt call for because ...wait for it.. they are a good tenant and pay a lot of rent.
Bad move why as a business decision did you make this
Colin Kaepernicks quote sounds like something off a Just Girly Things or Relationship goals page. Generic cliche crap
Hey and how about "Believing in Something" like, oh let's see, the men and women of the United States Military.
Dear world, if you wanna get rid of your , just send them to because some other need help!
I completely agree! Why not donate them to a charity, homeless, or a needy child? Somewhere out there, is a student who would love to go to school for the first time in Name Brand shoes/socks! It is Disgusting and Far from Humorous!
Imagine wasting $120 on some shoes just to burn them because the company has a good view on something and then acting like it's gonna effect them.
I just paid $200 for my new Nikes. No way Im burning these kicks.
So youre going to burn perfectly good items because your feelings are hurt? You could at least donate them to the homeless veterans that you pretend to give a shit about.
Wow Nike, so now its okay to take pictures of a man up close?? Give him personal space! This photo makes his eyebrows look huge! Disgusting, never getting my business again.
Mayo textured individuals are really out here putting on their Nike gear just so they can take a picture while cutting the symbol off of apparel they've already purchased from ? Man this another level of comedy!
Yeah I dont support Kaepernick kneeling either but damn donate your Nike stuff if youre going to be that ridiculous about it. Give it to someone who needs it. Nike isnt going to lose sleep about a few burnt sneakers

Nike Knee pads surge in sales.....although NFLers complain they're racist because they are white.

i never gave a flying fuck about which useless celebrities big brands used to market & i ain't about to start today a company using some dude in their advertising isn't gonna stop me from buying products that i like & have always bought. y'all stupid
Ive been a loyal customer my entire life...no Im not a Millennial! I also come from a LONG military lineage. Very disappointed and disgusted with you!
It's funny watching a company that uses child slave labor overseas to make their products all of a sudden become humanitarians. is an NFL/American Hero. is just a spineless sack of shit.
people burning products because of the AD supporting kneeling thoughts on the situation
Hire a fellow that disrespects the flag that so many brave men and women fought for and a man who disrespects our police heros guarantees that you have a least one less customer.
Per , the has released a statement on social justice in the wake of being the face of 's new ad campaign.
The world always find ways to keep us distracted and divided! Can't blame the we let situations divide us on our own! Remember why Christ died!
Nike just stated they don't care if you don't like it when someone kneels for the anthem, loves Fidel Castro and wears socks depicting cops as pigs. Pretty bold. Pretty stupid too.
See, this is why vaping is safer, it's not combustible...we can send you a starter kit if you'd like. Since it looks like you'll be laid up for a while.
People are going on about setting fire to shoes theyve already paid for. Im just over here hoping theyve seen enough Behind the Music to know not to burn them in the tub.
The is still losing money, fans, and followers. felt 3% of that today in their drop. Keep watching. America is over the drama show. We love our country, and our National Anthem, and our Veterans. like
But you still paid for your Nike shoes so not only if the shoe burning ridiculously stupid but also it does nothing to Nike? I dont understand? Grow up?
If brands want to separate themselves from racists, they should follow in Nike's footsteps. The people who are burning their apparel aren't people you want as your customer base. should aim for them since their products result in the whitest sheets.
To everyone burning their Nike clothes and shoes, just send them my way. You wont have to deal with those items anymoreI wear a M-L in shirts and medium in shorts. 10.5-11 in shoes. Thank ya
I rest my case! Great job . cry baby washed up QB Kapernick has a new supporter!

Can someone tell me how burning your own products actually hurts the company AFTER you had already spent your own money on it? already has your money for that product. You are the one who just lost money by burning your purchase.

Yesterday I bought some new Nike NFL clothes. Last night I read that Nike made Colin Kaepernick their new spokesperson. Today I am returning said Nike products. I served in the US Navy for nine & a half years
If you want to burn your gear just DM me I'll make sure its done...especially Retros, Griffeys, deadstock , and anything off-white...yea fuck Nike
Over labor day weekend I ordered cleats for my son. I will be returning them when I receive them. I refuse to spend my money on a company that hails a ZERO like Kaepernick a hero.
This whole shit is just yall following a trend learn the facts before yall hype shit up
i think i may just buy my first nike
Don't want your Nike apparel any longer? I know at least 10 kids my school that would happily accept them b/c they have little clothing. Stand your moral ground, but be mindful of others' needs.PS: Just do it (even if it's difficult) is a brilliant message!
So can I just start off by saying I need some new cleats preferably black ones. All you racists just hand me your shit before burning it. Gladly accepted. Also I accept Under Armor, Adidas, and Puma. Who all have front people that support Kap thanks!
I'll be boycotting Nike just as I have been for the past 41 years because their trainers are way overpriced.
Well I think I just bought my last pair of Nike running shoes.
If you feel you have to burn your gear, why not donate it instead? Good causes are better than chemicals in the atmosphere ... Oh wait, I forgot ‚Äì you're an idiot
I just got this tip from the little homie . Instead of , please, pretty please, donate your gear to the less fortunate. Homeless shelters, Group Homes, Battered Woman Shelters, , . Please and thank you
Wait until Nike trolls all these irate customers. They will release a camo hoodie that secretly will be part of the new Kaep line of clothing. These fools unknowingly will buy them up all while cutting up their socks.
So many talking about boycotting Nike. Has anyone stopped to think about the children in the factory in Thailand that got families to support?
are stupid.They're a waste of time.The is dumb.Granted, I am disappointed in this stunt w/Kaep, but I still socks and shirts more than & .I'm just tired of Kaep getting participation trophies for doing nothing.

Nike just dont do it. Nikes stock price $79.60Lets see where this takes us.
Folks.....let me be clear! These same people have been making Nike for how many years? Now that Kap got an EXTENSION of the deal he's currently in, it's a problem?
is so dumb, don't people have anything better to do than bitch about a shoe company , honestly STFU and live your own lives. Oh btw stop setting shoes on fire you just look dumb and crazy
Dear white people, No one cares about you burning merchandise you already paid for. I bet if starbucks supported kap yall would still be in a line to the back of the building paying ten dollars for a cup of coffee.
I'm not going to participate in the . I'm just going to keep buying Reebok.
It sure is interesting to watch the children of the 1% burn the raises of US federal workers.
ARE YALL REALLY OUT HERE BURNING UP NIKES CAUSE IF SO I LOVE A FEEE.99 SALE SIS. ILL DROP MY PO BOX ADDRESS
Great. Just great. Now, in addition to never watching the again, Ill never buy a product from again. Why the hell cant these companies leave the activism crap out of their business model?

I paid a shit ton of money for your goods and I just set them on fire for the world to see like fucking a moron because I wanted to be edgy. Take that 
I think THIS might be one of the reasons SOME guys out there are mad . Mad cause he got your girl *drooling*

I dont care about the . I havent bought Nikes sneakers since middle school because I have no interest in spending $80+ on sneakers that tend to suck. Never found their sneakers comfortable & they always feel like they run small.

you guys are idiots. I will not buy any of your products and will encourage others to do the same.
- bad move for Nike, supporting a racist, police-hater. It will prove to be a very costly decision
Valid. Donate them so that someone else can use them. They'll wear them out and throw them away.
Its so disgusting how people are mad at Kapernick for protecting but not Tebow for doing the SAME DURING THE SAME ANTHEM. shows who's really racist out here.
Pretty crudely said, but it's the truth. . More than 300 sexually abused more than 1000 children in the and not this much hell was raised, but Nike partnering with Kaep and you're in an uproar?

Just some proof that Nike really dont care about yall boycotting a damn thang
Dont you worry, there are plenty of us outside the US who are tired of identity politics, race-baiting and far-left politics being inserted into everything. Plus we can take this opportunity to remind folks that Nike are made by child labour in 3rd world sweatshops.

Destruction of Nike sneakers. With everything going on in our country you think we should really give a damn about that? Guess what: Nike could lose the entire US Market and still be a top 10 global brand in terms of revenue. THINK
I'm sure Nike is paying him a lot, so is he really sacrificing?? Was a Nike supporter no longer.
is actually genius. Black people are the biggest consumers when it comes to retail. This whole deal is going to help the company. And the makes racist look more dumb.
again peeps it's not about a political party to be human but just been emphasized Republicans sure make a big deal when they don't even practice what they preach.
Lemme wear my shit with more pride then before,respect to all the people who stand against injustice & racism.Yall real ones ! Still Fuck and yall lame asses that support bullshit,karma will take care of u!
Checks over stripes-U KNOW WHAT I LIKE! We just HIJACKED
Maybe may want to stay out of liberal social justice and stick to making child slave labor shoes.
The is actually working because today Nike stocks have plummet, losing $4 billion and counting.
So is losing ssoo much money rn because of their decision of having as their new face...Well somewhere in the world is saying come and buy some and Make America Great Again!
Welp folks, guess I'm getting a fresh set of socks . If'n y'all really cared & don't feel like DESTROYING something useful,d donate it to those vets y'all keep crying crocodile tears
Do you realise how many 8 year olds you just put out of a job?
In under 24 hours since Kaepernick first revealed the spot on Twitter, Nike received more than $43 million worth of media exposure, the vast majority of it neutral to positive. Incredible marketing job and to all that helped the cause.
Fuck the I support the movement
Before burning or destroying your Nike gear because you feel its disrespectful to Veterans and our country, my suggestion is find a homeless veteran and give the items to them. In January 2018 in the US we have over 40,000 homeless Veterans.
FOH wtf is a Imma continue to just do it
Here's my take. Instead of burning your Nike merch donate it to the homeless vets. But ever wonder that the party you're supporting w; this little tantrum is the root of why Veterans are homeless n why the Vets are not better taken care of?
. Just send them to me. Size 11. Only the ones that are over 175 dollars in value.
If Kap kneeled to boycott the flag and national anthem, then people participating in the are supporting police brutality.
Nike. Just Dump It.
Just remember if u u cant wear Jordans or Puma Im pretty sure they bought out puma. Just remember its deeper than just nike so if I see ya wearing any of that shit Im pullin cards lol
Fair play to for using ! The guy was just showing support to black Americans, fat rednecks need to stop crying, they wont be able to see out of their pointy hats
i will never buy another Nike product. As NFL offers measured response to Nikes Kaepernick ad, other reactions range from support to outrage
Wow, way to go Nike.... Un American and sensationalists. Wont use your stuff ever again!!!
Nike, Jordan, Converse , Hurley are all Nike owned. Thank you USA Today for pointing that out. Hello Adidas, Reebok, Pumas, Under Armour and anyone else not Nike.
When are the same people, who are screaming gonna boycott the government for not taking care of veterans, what have these same people done to helps a homeless vet?
Kaepernick supports BLM who chants for "dead cops", attacked Dallas police killing 5 with an AR-15, and burns down cities. never forget it.
Cant wait for the first porn where all the dude has on is Sketchers Shape Ups. Since Nike is obviously going under.
Personal opinion here, issue is not police brutality. It is black on black crime. Look at Chicago just as an example,
Theyll boycott the NFL & Nike over a black man but not the Catholic Church and the obscene amount of ongoing child abuse. Somethings very wrong here...
Nike can make a business decision. I can make a purchasing decision.
Slow down on your high horse there, people. Its an awesome campaign that Nike rolled out, but the underpaid child laborers who made your shoes are slightly underwhelmed with your crusade.
A former NFL player who's play was declining and the only way anyone knows his name is because of taking a knee.
Any yall gonna boycott Nike send me pairs size us 9.5
Just dont it!!!
For all of you destroying clothes or shoes because of the , please know that I have many students who literally dont have money for shoes and you are spoiled, entitled, privileged brats.
This is so... aggy. This is that Eminem murder my wife and kids shoot up a school mall festival sorority house unabomber energy.
I won't buy anymore Nike products. because I'm broke, BUT I AM OUTRAGED
Im a veteran. I made sacrifices. I support Colin Kaepernick.
If you are planning on throwing away unboxed Air Jordans size 10 just let me know and I will take care of them for you.
just do it! Sacrifice my ass. Tell that to the families of the warriors and police officers that come home under the flag a millionaire football player spits on. Go to hell Nike.
A friend posted on Facebook a great idea for all those people who want to burn their products because of how about you donate it instead!!!
He refused to compromise. He confronted injustice. He inspired others. A reminder of what our Ambassador of Conscience believes in.
If were smart they would immediately put out a video in support of and Kaepernick so they wont be associated with white supremacist man-babies
I do say my fellow !I suggest that those who are in marketing and are looking for gainful employment that you get your resumes updated and ready.I have the feeling that some positions are a once thriving shoe company will be hiring.Just a hunch.
I just spent $500 on Nike‚Ñ¢ merchandise to burn it because I saw a black man in an advert.Libtard Snowflakes just got friggin dunked on!
I'm done with your brand! So is my family. Next time you wanna get involved with politics..don't! You've lost a loyal customer forever!
Anyone looking to destroy their brand new airforce, cortez, presto or, vapormax, let me know. I have a recycling plant that will make great use of them!
I find the people burning gear hilarious. Its just an ad to make money. NIKE cares about one and only one thing... The people making marketing decisions at NIKE are probably anti-, but they knew the ad would generate attention.
Looks like 's decision to use as part of its campaign has prompted calls to . So what do local veterans & Alejandro Villanueva think of this? They both talk to me, coming up on at 5:55 pm.
4 the record, deciding 2 not buy is not h8, just my decision where to spend my $. My decision to stop watching the ? still not h8, just my decision on how best to spend my time. A Green Beret agrees w ? He can chose that, I don't have to agree.
Amen Brother! But doesn't care about Hero's just Dollar Signs! The Military are the Real Heroes and Best in Class
Just Ignore It, you say? Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker Rahm Emanuel
Shapiro at 'Newsweek': Nike's Kaepernick Ad Is Ridiculous
Ill never buy another Nike item in my life. Im not joking, havent watched an game since the infamous kneel from the jerk havent been inside a store since they decided to change their bathroom rules. Who else doesnt want my money?
We say we went hard for Kaep. But why is the support higher cause we getting things in return? "Support Kaep 'ok'" "Nikes come with it 'OH HELL YEAH! IM FINNA BUY ALL THE NIKES I CAN'"
These are the people who brought us the Trump presidency!When burning shoes or shorting $NKE to own the libs.For a $127.5B company, itll continue to head north in the long haul. Bad publicity works like a charm!
There are actual people burning sportswear because a sportswear company used a particular athlete in an advert.People are dumb !!
Your sacrifice doesn't mean anything unless you die as a soldier.Just summarizing every tweet against this campaign.
So Imma just weigh in on this gig going on.
I haven't gotten a pair of Nikes in a few years (awful customer service at Foot Locker caused that) but now I think I might buy a pair to support Nike.
So you are more upset about Trump Supporters saying mean things about Colin Kaepernick than you do with Nike using actual child slaves to make their products?
Yeah, HOW ABOUT THAT? And not only boycott nike- But go ahead and boycott EVERYTHING else they own like Converse and etc Racists just mad
I just hate everyone and everything so I think everything is stupid. I hate the dude that everyone is talking about. I hate Nike. I hate people mad at Nike. I hate people not mad at Nike. I hate people.
Do people really think is concerned about people burning things they already bought. ..because they're mad Thanks for the support and appreciates it too
is just people making fun of imaginary Republicans destroying their Nikes
I am so amazed by the latest campaign with . I don't really need any extra gear, but they have inspired me and are definitely getting my business. And to those who , they already have your money, don't lie.
Maybe we can all pretend that he didnt wear socks pregame depicting police officers as pigs. Oh yeah, its ok because its in the name of social justice. Risk everything? Hes getting paid by Nike! Broncos offered him a contract and he refused. Hello Under Armour.
Yes or No --> Are you done with Nike because the ad campaign featuring ?We have more on the debate NEXT on starting at 5
On Jerry Jones praised and CEO Phil Knight, but declined comment on company's decision to use ex QB Colin Kaepernick in ad campaign. But it seems like has tweeted support for Kaepernick
I only hope that before the attacks, will remain faithful to its empowering ideology of "just do it" and inclusive for all.The attacks of a few misplaced of what happens in the United States should not even worry them.Those who want unity, we are more.
Vous pouvez m'envoyer toutes vos paire de Nike!
My 7 yo wants things because "they're cool" and I told him I can't afford that, then I see y'all motherfuckers cutting your shit up. Why not donate it to people who'll actually wear it. Must be nice to have money like that.
Nike assembles their shoes in sweatshops in Cambodia, Honduras etc so they can spend millions to support cop hating.
Uses Overseas
Wow, what a huge mistake your company has made. Lost my business for sure. Disgraceful to have him as the face of your company.
The is stupid. I will buy more Nike, and support them more.
y'all white muhfukkas cray if you think you gone hurt sales by boycottin. Nike been preyin on the poor black community for DECADES. Nike OWNS black people! smh
If youre part of the thing, please just block me. Wearing my s today.
Just Do It! Aint no over here. Id love to be the face of Nike too.
maybe the Nike advertising team owns Adidas or Reebok stock and they are looking to make a killing in the stock market and retire. Only plausible explanation I can think of for this.
I grew up in Oregon and was around my whole life. It's funny watching a company that uses child slave labor overseas to make their products all of a sudden become humanitarians. is an NFL/American Hero. is just a spineless sack of shit.
Just DON'T do it--buy anymore Nike products, that is.
Hes not playing cause he sucks balls. No other reason , you keep trying to make a hero out of him tho.
, Just do it
just got beat up for wearing New Balance. "Yo u a racist 4 not wearing Nike" They still beat me cause i was wearing a red tshirt "you must be a blood" beat even more cause im chubby "u must got $ to be fat, white privilege"Good thing they didnt see my MAGA hat.

I honestly believe Nike wants the vast majority of us who have been loyal to their product to just go away...
Nike will do just fine without me, but just the same, Ill observe
LOl. Just watch.
Nike uses third world labor to make shoes in the cheapest possible way then targets minority teens to sell to at prices they cant afford. How much money is going to help the something cause?
really? Just coz of an ad
The one thing for the life of me I just don't understand, what does burning your shoes/clothes accomplish? Not just this situation, but jerseys and all also. In all actuality you're only hurting yourself for you're the ones who bought them. IDK just lost.
All you conservatives wanting to boycott due to your hate of Kaepernick, heed this...You are just as batshit crazy as liberals who want to ban, say, a fast food restaurant as they made a small contribution to the GOP.
30 years of being a loyal customer was just flushed down the toilet, by Nike selecting that racist, cop hating, piece of SHIT Kaepernick, as the face of their marketing. say hello to
is the top discussed Trending top this minute. Visit for images
Nike: it's so crazy it just might work.
Covered why lost his job and can't get a new one ... last year. He was SACKED in because of terrible play & attitude. .
I encourage everyone to participate in the . The demand curve will shift to the left, thus lowering the equilibrium price on the supply and demand curve. Therefore, there will be some nice sales that I can take advantage of to cop some sneakers on the low.
Retweet if you support
Knowing full well you are capitalizing on this for press I will none the less switch to your brand as I place my order today because you brought massive awareness to this important issue. Thanks for supporting .
I hope everyone participating in keeps that same energy when it comes Catholic Churches raping kids
follow me Just Dot It
I stand with and These are my Nikes and they are not for burning. Show your support and I will never join the
I love ! All the angry white people on the thread are hilarious
ae, quem n√£o vai mais usar Nike por conta do Kaepernick, eu uso camisa tamanho G e cal√ßo 40, t√¥ querendo um t√™nis novo, ent√£o qualquer coisa entrem em contato
I dont know about y'all but I just ordered all kinds of apparel
Thanks for let us know youre a racist
Breaking news: Nike gives in to outrage...posthumously replaces CK with this guy! Sure he was a terrorist, said Nikes CEO. But at least he actually sacrificed something.
Proudly sent my daughter to school today with her new kicks. Who would have known that besides being kick-ass shoes, they would be a symbol for social justice & tolerance.
Looks like is just starting to feel the pain
And when people think is a stupid businessman, look at
There's legitimate reasons to dislike and to boycott Nike. But for all the folks waxing gleeful about how they made a YUGE mistake and this will hurt the company?LMAO, you silly twits...this was a calculated BUSINESS decision made by EXPERTS in marketing.
I bloody love nike sports stuff anyway, but Ill def buy more now. So often big business wont touch divisive situations so fair play to them
Why is everyone arguing with people over NIKE. Its clear that people are just against anything just look has any of these people addressed the reason he knelled? Ill wait
If you really wide awake wire me your salary since causing $NKE stock to drop & I'm plugging shares for the low.What's your budget? ‚Äì at Wall Street Parking Ramp
Even if you stink at football and use a "cause" to keep the cash flowing. Spoiled brat.
Its probably just a few idiots that burned them brother, Im sure 99% of people in the are not out there burning the merch and will simply stop buying Nike. Nice try pretending thats the majority though.
Also, maybe instead of burning your stuff, consider donating. There are many places that would be grateful for your support.
Just Kneel it
Here's my combat boots that I've *stood* in, while saluting the flag for many years. Thx to the deal, I'll also be taking a knee.. from wearing these or supporting anything from again.
"It's a celebration and everyone should invite meRoll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes" -'ll be proudly sporting all my Nikes from here on out. Burn your clothes if you want, I wouldn't want to be wearing the same thing as you anyway.
To those burning gear in the - how about you just give up/donate to those who need it instead of this more risky and harmful way to show your unmeasured anger towards a marketing campaign. Oh, kudos to the marketing team that cooked this one up!
150 dollar shoes made by someone who wishes they had the money to just burn them. Someone they signed made you mad but there was labor put on those.
Dont worry Nike some of us hasnt forgotten about the child labors and women!!
Actual confusion about - whats the problem? A big capitalist business is backing a big American issue 4 awareness. Am I dumb?
This Nike boycott is officially a new level of stupidity. Youre burning their products just because of who THEY CHOSE to make the face of THEIR BRAND... Can someone please tell me how this is interfering with their personal life and why is there a need to boycott?
guess who not boycotting me. We will always buy Nikes matter of fact just bought 3 pair.
time to step it up! Don't do the same foolish mistakes made or you will lose over 3 billion in 24 hours
Last week I special ordered customized Nike Shoes for my Wifes Birthday, today Im calling to cancel the order
Kinda obvious Nike waited till school shopping was finished to announce the new face. I was set to purchase another high end Nike sneaker, but now will have to go with or . It will be a long time before I think of buying anything .
More fake patriots using the flag to mask their racism and bigotry - thank you via
CALL NIKE AND LET THEM KNOW HOW YOU FEEL!!!!I just did this and it worked!! CALL & RT
People are dilusional if they really believe this will hurt Nike! I run a store that is mostly Nike product. TRUST ME! Nike will be just fine!
If u feel a type of way about making the face of their new campaign, please send all your NEW Nike stuff my way I know the best way to get rid of them. Trust me. Dont waste ur time burning them yourself. I got you
Anyone else observing the progress of with absolute fascination? Just me?
You have absolutely no idea what real sacrifice is. Your sanctimonious, high horse, grandstanding is just another example of how out of touch with reality you are.
. Well thats just despicable! Adidas look great now!
Burn your sneakers all you want. Youre still going to support 1 way or another
I have a pair of eye glasses with the Nike logo on them. Im not burning them but i dont want to endorse them either. I dont care what color you are i just dont believe you should take a knee during our National Anthem if you live in this country.
ppl burning Nikes because they consider Colin un-american, thus admitting that they owned , a shoe that is not manufactured in America,
I'm so sick of seeing 's face everywhere. Couldn't they have focused the ad on his knees or something???
We could just burn racial inequality in this country. Yeah, let's burn that.
Mine are already in the Goodwill donation bin. I know I spend 10k a yr on Nike products... I hope more ppl do the same and cut them off at the knee caps.
I've never owned Nike shit to burn never have supported them.
I just know Uncle Phil is so unbothered like:
Just do it. *Throwing away OR burning.

I love all the anti nike people who could be donating their items to the less fortunate are deciding to just burn resources. Yep All . Can really tell they care about humanity.
Why would a campaign cause the ?
I have to admit I'm enjoying watching backfire on conservatives who are spectacularly proving just how hypocritical and thin-skinned they are.For one thing, Nike already has your money and you are becoming the very "snowflakes" you love to mock.
Just a thought....
Just do it even if it means sacrificing everything we stand for?!please share
Just bought these high tops for hip hop class. Thanks for the inspiration. I wasn't planning to buy anything, but you inspired me!
Good job for helping to foment more division and hatred. We didn't have enough already. Signed,The World
is not a social justice warrior. He is just a shitty quarterback that can can grow one hell of an Afro puff!!!!
Looks like some just virtue signal about sacrifice, while others are willing to put principles before profit and material possessions.
I reported to work last week 30 minutes early per usual. When the clock struck 9:00, and the workday began, I went and took a knee in front of the store. I was immediately fired. I had everything, now I have nothing. Definitely not worth it. Thanks Colin.
These people burning products should burn it while theyre wearing it and do us all a favour
Does buying Jordans count to help support the awareness of the anti movement? I mean, those Jordan 5 International Flights are sick!
Yea....dont just do that
There are many reasons to but using Colin Kaepernick in an advert certainly isnt one of them.
If any of you seriously dont want your Nikes anymore. (which is hilarious to me) please DM me for my address so I can get them from you and give them to people in need. Thanks!!
This is why you don't mix politics with sports...or anything else for that matter. Can I just watch some football without a bunch of bullshit?
Thank you to all the service members who fight for our country, is nothing but a retired TV star.
white ppl rlly out here fuckin up they nike gear because they believe in ignorance.. wow
For a brief moment I thought I was supposed to burn my Nikes. Which was a flash of panic as that's literally all our household wears. Phew.
What Are You Doing?! Nike Makes Colin Kaepernick The New Face Of Their Just Do It Campaign
Nike uses child slave labor to make their shoes so fuck them and the people who buy them
Have a read of our new blog post! The focus on and whether they can seriously challenge for the title! Did the win against give fans false hope? -
Indigent Rosa Parks dignified Old Glory seated. Cupiditous indignified it knelt.
Its perfectly acceptable to boycott something when the message being pushed is offensive and reprehensible....I'm talking about Adam Sandler movies.
Dear Can you please explain to us, whats going on, do u guys also display rats at your warmers/fridge? We need answers
Just bought some new nikes
just do it. boycott Nike.
Does anyone else find it ironic that a company which uses sweatshops and child labor to produce its wares hired a multi-millionaire to make themselves look socially conscious?
Can every single company that creates technology responsible for connecting people to the internet, please say they stand with Colin Kaepernick?That way Trump supporters will destroy their computers and leave this space to decent human beings.Thanks!
Burning your for the ? ... you must be a desperate..!
remember how stupid everybody felt when people burned LeBron James' jerseys, and then he came back and gave y'all a championship? Same thing is gonna happen w/ Nike. A little bad news ain't never hurt nobody
Im going to burn my old New Balance shoes as part of the and see how many people share the video because Im patriotic and stuff for burning my Nike gear
Nike stocks down 3.19% (2.60 a share). Colin is not the answer to growing a company. Hes a liability and definitely not an inspiration. Nike if u support in-American behavior then maybe stock prices falling and rabid sales dropped will wake u up!
Feel like should have just slapped our service men & women in the face. Neither of u understand sacrifice.
It would be great if all those doing the would apply the same logic to who has actually insulted veterans, intelligence agencies, and families who made the ultimate sacrifice.
we moved from CA to Texas and i can tell you most parents will not buy Nike for their kids here because of this
I'm. Crying. Have that same energy pls and help a brotha out. I wouldn't care if they weren't so glaringly adamant about this stuff.
People will wear Nike knowing they use child labor, under pay employees, and use unsafe environmental practices BUT they support equality with Colin Kaepernick and that's the line, start burning shit. WTF?
Definitely thought was an interesting pick. Unsure if it was the best business move, but also anti- .
anyone thats throwing away or burning their can donate them to a good cause me for information on where to send.
we could Make Sock Suspenders Great Again! people: this is totes mcgotes the best way to ... Get yours today!!(And post selfies please)
maybe youve addressed. Didnt listen to last broadcast. Nike? and my Irish are underrated just saying
To everyone thats doing the if you got a pair of lebron 15 sz 11 that you wanna burn hmu.....I got very good use for them
The United States Flag stands by the people in a country for the people. It (cont)
I detest when political or social movements involve commerce and branding by companies like Nike. Its insulting to the root cause. They dont give a shit about the cause only $$
Who else is going to buy a pair of sneakers this week just because?
I've been part of an unintentional for years because I can never find a light shoe from them anymore that has that leather big toe reinforcer and I got tired of the holes. I dont want an all-leather shoe, just the reinforcement thing
Hope the has an out clause for their 8 year uniform deal. You should not bite the hand that feeds you. The NFL did not need this.
Throwing on my socks and shoes cause they're the best out there. Walking out the door not giving a fuck. Not going to let negativity make me stop liking wearing stuff I like lol

Doctors Remind Trump Supporters To Take Nikes Off Before Burning Them
People are destroying their Nike prod... Na fam all I seen is the same crusty ass socks circulating twitter. Something aint addin up.
Im done. Bad decision to make a part of your organization. Its decisive at best. Ill completely stop using your products.
Well done ! Huge respect to Supporting you from UK. Any morons cutting there Nike clothes up for , please just give them up to a charity shop or people who need them instead.
Do I agree with Nike hiring Kapernick to be their spokesperson? Heck no! Should he be saying he sacrificed everything? Heck no! That's easy when you make 39 million a year.Will I be boycotting Nike? No. Because they make good shoes. Idc who advertises for them.
So many people on the and bandwagon for disrespecting the flag but they sleep just fine knowing many of our veterans go to sleep hungry, homeless and alone.
Im creating a drop-off center at my house. Please join me in the by bringing me your DS and above size 12 and sneakers. Hell, Ill even take kicks. Please keep them in the original box.
Pat Tillman won't be getting any endorsement contracts. He not only believed in something, he lived and died acting on that belief, instead of just talking about it for the cameras.
Yes. No, Im not a racist. Why? Because how can we advertise and promote someone who cant STAND for our national anthem but they want us to stand behind their cause? Hes overrated and overappreciated.
The same people who are mad at Nike for supporting (Superbowl/Pro Bowl QB) Colin Kaepernick are the same humans who are complicit with Generational Incess & Meth usage within their household. But anywho, JUST DO IT & F tha flag!
Wow.... says stand up for what you believe in..... and the racists jump in with a burning of the cross.. errr sorry checkmark.. ?? supporters are completely mindless.. or / supporters.. same thing.
Tip for people planning to burn their gear: pile it at the base of the cross you were planning to burn and light them up together.
As reported on CNBC, adding politics to sports with a former NFL player glorified insulting our country/flag was done to gain favor with Millennials. The rest of us should react by taking our money elsewhere. Nike should Be ashamed.
I want pacemaker manufacturers to start speaking out against Trump so that Trump supporters start destroying their pacemakers to own the libs.
TBH, there have already been numerous reasons to boycott Nike for years, like slave wages and child labor. So whether you for or against kneeling, you shouldn't be buying Nike products anyway!
I vow, because endorsements and rewards are for winners accomplishers and to those who sacrificed to gain !
What a loser of a company...I just did it...will no longer buy Nike stuff. MAGA
So hes not supposed to make money? If he didnt, you would just call him another welfare recipient living off your taxes. Colin actually gives back to the community. Keep up with your fake outrage though. Wrong side of history again.
Do you support the boycott against Nike over Kaepernick campaign?Please Vote and Retweet. if you want ( just blew it ) shirt you can get one from here :
Funny those bitching about Nike being made made in sweatshops, are the same ones that use an iPhone or any other type of smartphone. . Lol
. Clearly doesn't get it. Supporting a sniveling crybaby who chose himself before his team.
DONT BURN YOUR CRAP! DONATE IT TO VETERANS NGO!At least thats what someone who really cares about vets would do.... But who am I to talk logically? Im just a French men living in a crazy land.
John Rich just got himself another follower! And, Im pretty certain my days of buying any Nike products are behind me!
My new .How is it?Looking for a Business card or ?Contact me :
Because choosing not to stand during the national anthem to boycott police brutality is HORRIBLE. People are ridiculous.
What Kap did wasnt about black or white, it was about justice for all, no matter what colour. And that can be done by kneeling or by refusing to give up your seat. Sometimes the smallest gestures are the most powerful.
Anyone getting rid of a size 11 us back to the future shoes let me no! Please do not burn them
. gets support from . Does anyone see a coincidence here?
People are talking about nike stock falling because they signed . But if you read this article, adidas wanted to sign him too. So all you guys running to Adidas, do you really understand what is going on here??
Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Just do it!
Just a thought....
The same types of racist pieces of human garbage leading the today were throwing rocks at MLK in the 60's. They were ultimately rendered impotent by history and the same fate lies ahead for their chromosomally challenged brethren today.
All those Nike shoes on fire as those without shoes look down at their blistered feet. For sure, Jesus wept.
Ill just leave this here
- slave labor shoes and enemy-within politics makes nike a truly disgusting company. is a disgusting pig. - the enemy within
To the countless supporters and American ‚Äòpatriots who are burning, ripping up and/or tossing out your gear, heres a suggestion.
People burning Nike products to waste because they've got offended but ain't boycotting shit about the inhuman treatment to Nike's staff on asia and the extreme overpricing bullpoo
you guys just lost a long time customer !! Your company shouldnt play politics. has all my business now.
At least Nike could have given us shareholders advance warning before pulling a bonehead libtard stunt like choosing a has been athlete who disses the National Anthem as their advertising face. When did corporate America become so PC stupid? My stock tanked!
Just do it.
Cant help but notice that its all white people supporting the . So youre mad that Kaepernick sticks up behind what he believes in and now hes the face of ?! Ho about you
- slave labor shoes and enemy-within politics makes nike a truly disgusting company. is a disgusting pig.
I ain't seen these supporters this mad since OJ got off
I'm deployed in the Airforce and all I see the same people who is burning Nike's was the same people burning the American flag when Obama was in office
Love your head Coach but sorry can't support Nike
I have to say the is the biggest backfire Ive ever seen. Nikes ad agency really know what theyre doing. Never worn the brand but maybe this will change that. But all this doesnt help divided America much, does it?
We should be really focusing on the real issues in the world. Instead, we have individuals blowing this out of context. Whenever you want know Colin's POV about kneeling just or it. Instead of chosing to be consciously stupid.
This is pretty stupid, I'm sure at least 1 athlete on your favorite team, 1 musician in your favorite band, 1 actor in your favorite movie or tv show, or even 1 friend has a different political view than yours, some people are just idiota
Did the armed vet suggest he wear pig socks and support Castro too? Or did ?
When I was a kid I was invited to an event and I realized, with horror, the hosts were burning books and albums because said something about Jesus. Now, same types burning sneakers. It's so dark ages.
So... didn't Nike do an ad with that Pat guy who went to war? Saying the same thing as Colin ad? lol
Just going to leave this here .... thanks .
Facebook Page Launched "Just Burn It" to Boycott and Burn Nike Products via
I just have one suggestion as it comes down to this whole . For any idiot out there burning their Nike gear, do the world a favor and make sure to put on all this gear as you light it on fire. The world as a whole will be much better off without your stupidity...
Does Reverend Bocephus wear Nike? Hell no, Brothers and Sisters!
You know how to get crickets on Twitter, tweet an : "Like Pheidippides, boycotters can just say 'Nike!', and die"
You stand for a person who kneels at one of the only things that unites. No more nike for me.
The is stupid, enough said. Burning shoes because a company is standing behind an important cause? This movement doesnt disrespect the flag OR veterans, how about they finally stand against police brutality instead of actively denying its existence
Trump supporters love to burn shoes and lick boots.
Stones on marketing To be cynical and maybe unfair, would they make the same risk if alienating fans of a sport on the rise? e.g.
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker White liberals know they gotta keep us on the plantation... Democrats haven't changed one single bit.
Yes they did as I m sure they projected White crackers just showing us what a bunch of dumb asses they really are but then again these are the people that support the man who repeatedly says he would FK his daughter so u know where their values lie fkin idiots
I mean seriously how funny is it that some guy got so wound up and upset that he thought the best thing to do with his time was to walk outside and set his shoes on fire WHILE THEY WERE ON HIS FEET. Like cool bro you really showed them!
JUST DO IT: did make a good move by hiring to be the spokesperson on the 30th anniversary of the iconic "Just Do It" slogan? Call (901) 3000-TOM LIVE at 3 Pacific/6 Eastern and let's talk about it.
If it means masses of nasty, bigoted, racist US republicans setting fire to themselves them Im all for the
This goes to show that there are extremes to either political side. Some Republicans want because of Kaepernick, some Democrats want to because of contributions. People may do things you dont agree with, be an adult and learn to deal with it.
September Fourth, Two Thousand and Eighteen. The day thousands of pairs of white Nike Air Monarch's were viciously burned, shot at, and ultimate destroyed by angry cookout dads who had nothing better to do.
just found out this is trending because of the black people making jokes about it
Church can be a really toxic place yall.. be careful. Just because its Gods house doesnt mean you should feel uncomfortable or unsafe. .
The US announced the cancellation of $300m in Coalition Support Funds to today, but please keep burning your $150 shoes! Youre not making us look at all
I wonder if all these people get this pissed off about racial injustice. Are they this angry when an unarmed black kid is killed by law enforcement?
If you're going to destroy your own stuff because someone else has feelings, you're a stone cold idiot.
Me in 2011: !Black Ppl: Shut up ashy Hotep! Me in 2018: Ppl: Shut c00n! You're just tap dancing for Trump supporters.
Twitter needs 2 stop pretending:a. was a great QBb. Kaep was considered a starting QB post-2014c. Kaep would have played in a backup role making backup moneyNOPE.MARTYRED himself because he saw his future was bleak.
Really dont understand how the turned into a race war. The man took a knee instead of standing up for the men and women who have given there life for our country. This isnt about color, its about respect.
I went out and bought myself a new pair of running shoes. I needed them anyway. I usually buy but this time I chose . Nike doesn't respect America.
All these people out here burning Nike apparel are just going to end up buying more Nike apparel to replace the Nike apparel they are burning .
I'm curious whether he used a Tiki Torch to start the fire? Asking for a friend.
To the team owners, remember the guy thats suing you and the company that supported him when you are signing uniforms contracts. , ,
And what are you standing up for and giving up for it? Youre the poster boy for any race being able to make it in America, in the land of equal opportunities, no oppression and no injustice.
Did you use a Tiki Torch to start the fire? Asking for a friend.
Under Armour is a white supremacist supported brand.
Now that he is COLIN KAEPERNIKE ...I'm on the and I am proud to say I just bought some Asics shoes
I cannot say this enough: social justice isnt good for sales
I usually wear a 9 1/2 in Nike. So you outraged dude bros can send them to me.
. Why the sudden cry for a because brought to injustice. Where was this type of outcry to unfair labor practices ex sweatshops, childlabor. Where was the outcry to MakeAmericaGreat stop lynching (Strange Fruits)blacks??
Define irony: a bunch of snowflakes destroying their shoes because they dont like a representative of a brand, who in their next breath will berate those who dont like the president or agree with their views. Time to look in the mirror when you say snowflake
Lots of people have opinions about the ad campaign and the . Many we spoke to outside the in support him and the store. The new billboard sits above the Union Square location.
If Reebok's classics become popular because Colinzas upset with Nike I'mma be suuuuper upset. And any "my past was in these streets" dudes from the south need to too
Lets get something straight as the lauds By no means does speak for 99.9% of us Veterans and as African American NAVY SEAL said: I will fight by standing Nate Boyer is a liberal Democrat.
Perhaps if the same folks speaking out against also spoke out against the murder of unarmed Blacks by bigots with badges, there would be no reason to kneel.
Yall are worried about disrespecting veterans yet you are destroying perfectly good clothing instead of donating it to those veterans youre so worried about. But thats none of my business.
Seeing these racist people burn their Nike clothes and shoes cracks me up because it shows how dumb they truly are. I mean I thought these Americans loved doing yard sales
I have not purchased a pair of Nike shoes in over 15 years. It's not because of what athletes they have as their spokes people. It's because they learned it takes a 10th of what they charge for shoes to actually make them. They can do whatever they want for business
I don't really care about the Nike/Kapernick thing. I care about their use of child/underpaid labor in Asia. That's messed up.
Meanwhile the Federal Reserve takes everything from all of us and we don't even care!
And what is he standing up for and giving up for it? He's the poster boy for any race being able to make it in America, in the land of equal opportunities, no oppression and no injustice like he claims anyways

Just Do It.
I would join the but I have never owned a pair because I am not a degenerate ghetto rat
I just want to see them keep that same energy taking off the nike swoosh off their fav jerseys
First puts their swoosh on a niqab, the universal symbol of female subjugation. Now theyre making an anti-America, anti-law enforcement bigot the face of their just do it campaign.

Can we just make the a bipartisan effort?"Adidas and Nike pay poverty wages to the thousands of women in their supply chain that sew the football shirts and shoes of players and supporters."
So many conservatives trying to toss out a "more worthy" white man instead of for that campaign. Maybe just tell us you didn't read the book by Tillmans family. And while you're at it, donate your nike money to the
People are really cutting/destroying their Nike clothes because of the Kaepernick ad? Yall do realize you already paid Nike for the clothes, and youre not hurting Nikes value, only the value of your own property?
Wasnt in the mood to go to the gym after work but now Im going just to wear my Nike proud
The Nike brand just elevated to another level.
I'm gonna start making sportswear out of used rags but with stars and stripes all over. Made in Vietnam, but I'm gonna call it "TroopWear - For True Americans" and sell it at premium prices. Then I'm gonna buy a yacht and pay for it with cash.
I REFUSE to allow you to label me something that I & God know that I am not. I REFUSE to be labeled by someone who doesn't know me. I REFUSE to let your bigotry & hate define ME. ONLY God judges me. YOUR words are worthless to me. YOUR hate won't work any longer.
People are destroying and getting rid of their Nike merch. But, why do that to the stuff you already bought? You already gave your money to them. Just don't buy Nike's stuff. Smh.P.S. For the 10,000th time, kneeling wasn't about the f-king flag.
I Just bought stock. I support . Thank you for supporting and the movement.
p galera q n√£o deseja usar mais os seus produtos Nike, por favor me envie eles pois eu tenho uma c√¢mara de g√°s aqui em casa e irei queimar os produtos, por favor entre em contato na DM.
Just curious... Are we going to make every brand acknowledge their political stances so people can strictly shop with their kind? It seems expensive for producers & consumers alike to continue destroying products bc of politics.
I still dont boycott a company because they dont agree with me. However, I dont think it helps Nikes image to make CK the face of the company when he just isnt that good. He was benched long before the movement.
In the name of their stupid liberal politics Nike takes a $3.75 Billion nose dive. Was it worth it Nike? Personally, I hope you go out of business.
Everyone retweet this-it's very important- you can also take a picture of yourself on your knees to show support for Nike &use this hashtag above. This is one of the most important things to do ever.

Imagine this: Nike isn't trending. And as long as they support an Un-American They Never Will Again. Too bad for their slave-laborers in third world sh!thole countries
Good thing people can afford more shoes with trump's tax cutsI'm onTeam Donate if you're on team Hope they can support People in need since they can't support People support ending social injustice
If you destroy a product you already own because of recent public statements by the manufacturer, you're the idiot.
How does the hit Nike's stock price took after the Kap unveiling compare to damage caused by Armstrong, Jones and Gatlin's drug scandals?
Wow! The is doing real damage. I own stock in and its share price hasn't been this low since... since... dear god, all the way back in August! The 17th of August!!!
is just just going to drive up sales.
I'm a cartoonist but I have to take a stand (or a knee) on racial police brutality. has nothing to do with patriotism-everything to do with divisiveness.
, if you're boycotting because of a football player who hurt your snowflake feelings, but give little shits to Nike using third world child slave labor, you're part of the problem.
Before yall burn and waste all that stuff just send it to me Ill take care of it
lol Nike stocks now at -3.03% wait...-3.04% no, wait! -3.05% If I keep hitting refresh it just keeps falling!
Mass contributor of slave labor; the Biggest contributor to doing business outside of this country; the Largest oppressor of people of color known to man is now coming out with a Kaepernick line...
So, if anyone is going to burn their stuff... can they just give it to me instead? Just kind of pointless to burn stuff that could be used.
comptez pas sur moi pour jeter mes Nike... d√©j√† que Nike>>>> Adidas vous voulez que je porte quoi
So CK supporters? Yall gonna boycott companies if they support trump? Asking for myself
Just burned my Dunlop tennis shoes. Just because they are horrific looking
So for those of you burning your shoes instead mind sending them my way, ya girl is broke and in need of new sneakers. Plus, Ill also see if I can donate some to people who actually need shoes, thanks! Lets not be wasteful here.
This Nike boycott issue is incredible to me. "Just doing it" for the "likes" all for show. Don't donate them or give them to the needy, instead post a video of burning something you already paid money for having no clue what this is really about. Stay inside.
Thanks I will be buying more nikes and so will the rest of us!!
I can honestly say I have not ever bought anything in my life, just prefer , much better kit for your money
If you out here burning Nikes.... I ware a size 10. Send me a picture of them janks if you just dont want em anymore.
Honestly, if others believe that by setting fire and ruining Nike products is helping anybody, that's completely absurd. You may have just wasted your money, but there are many other people in the nation who could have used those quality products. So childish.
Nike doesnt have your business anyways, they arent worried
What would Deplorables drive if Ford and Chevy decided to use Kaepernick on their pickup truck ads?
Hay Collin kapernick how about you try STANDING FOR SOMETHING. like the American flag that so many men and women have given EVERYTHING to defend not just there monetary things.
The one thing for the life of me I just don't understand, what does burning your shoes/clothes accomplish? Not just this situation, but jerseys and all also. In all actuality you're only hurting yourself for you're the ones who bought them. IDK just lost.
Hey if yall got any brand new Js yall wanna get rid off because of the boycott. Dont burn em. Give em to me. Ill happily take em.
Im not buying anymore. Not because I hate them, but because SNKRS never selects me for shit. LET ME BUY YOUR SHOES DAMNIT
I've made up some Nikes in honour of Mr Kaepernick. They're 70's style for his hair and his last teams colours, unfortunately because of racism.
I find the sad, hilarious, and shameful at the same time. Shows me many of you don't get the issues at hand, are more racist and anti-american than you realize, and are apart of the problem that's plaguing the nation.
great! I already boycotted NFL because I would smack my kid in little league if he kneeled during his teams national anthem. Now, Nike too! Only Adidas now!!
Don't get me wrong, I'm down for a of , if it's related to their use of child slave labor. But I find it laughable that are crying over a fucking football player, get a fucking life.
Anyone out there wanting to how about you get ahold of someone like Titus here and donate? Do some good to counter your perceived evil.

Conservatives Burn Shoes after Nike Makes Colin Kaepernick Face of 'Just Do It' Campaign via
No need to cut your socks. Just wash them 3 times, and they will fall apart on their own.
Im glad people like use their voices to make changes. Thats what I hope to do with my new initiative
keep cutting up but you fools still paid your money and keep posting cause yall just advertising the brand makes yall look dumb as hell
Yeah Im just gonna not destroy my clothes & shoes
Disgusted by the outrage and hypocrisy of so many people because of their hatred towards one man's actions.Saddened that said hatred threatens to quell the beautiful message. Challenged to live out said message. Kudos . Kudos
Great way to increase the long-term value of your brand: ensure all the gun-toting, closet racist rednecks disown their own  stash - someone just remind them to take it off first...
People can be insane at times..how can someone pay for shoe and lit it up because of ..Its Just Like Entering a coffee shop, paying for the coffee and spilling the coffee on the floor..Who is losing? PATHETIC!!
If you're so outraged that you're boycotting Nike and/or burning shoes, go throw some of that energy behind a cause that's actually worthwhile. Get over yourselves.
Lol kkk gonna be mad that said I have decided to destroy my nikes. By wearing them every day and having them be wore out by my tremendous weight.
If you want to then do it because they knowingly use cheap child labor in China and third world countries, not because they are using the racist for their ad campaign.
Wait, I'm confused by the . Isn't it counterintuitive to what we're all praising Nike for? I know I'm missing something big and obvious but I've been confused all day about that and finally need to ask.
These people just dont get it. Newsflash: Nobody wants a lecture on Sunday from a 20 year old black millionaire about how racist the country is. Stop doubling-down on this crap. In the meantime, enjoy watching your stock and sales crash.
Privilege (& idiocy) is being able to burn & destroy ur expensive merchandise. Items that so many in our own nation cant even afford to purchase.In fact, burning ur property isnt even, by definition, a boycott. It's just stupidity...they already have ur money.
The market just did it! Pat Tillman did it first! Kaepernick who?! U should b ashamed Nike! Stay strong shareholders & SALE!
Nike Stock Plunges After Tapping Kaepernick as 'Just Do It' Campaign Poster Boy via
50% of the people hating are racist, the other 50% just following what everyone else is doing just because. Yall are the problem. These cops start whooping on their kids then theyll see the light then. is real.
Instead of burning your for the , donate it to good causes. Think of charity shops who always need donations. Then think how selfish you're being. Let's combat this negative, by donating our unwanted clothes even Nike, and turn it into a positive!
Burning sneakers, cutting 5 year old shorts or socks..... wheres the trashing of your favorite players Nike jersey? I must be missing those vids.
I've never bought Nike but I'll trust Twitter here
Las marcas son significados y como tal deben tomar una posici√≥n, guste o no, como l√≠der en la categor√≠a lo hace, otros no.
If yall are gonna burn all your Nike shoes, just send them to me. Ima size 10.5-11 Pls and thank u

I care just enough to make a meme
come see us!
REAL RAP for your narratives. Donate that shit to a place where ALL the homeless vets living on the street can put it to use smh.
Why not just give the Nike apparel away to someone who is in need? Or are yall angry, selfish, and wasteful??
If you think is "disrespecting the flag," you should be equally disgusted by how disrespectful we as a country are to POC and to black men, especially.
idiots do know nike isnt the only shoe company that stocks dropped today. Its because of NAFTA, not kaepernick, but yall dont do your research per usual. So please, continue being mad and spreading lies lol
What did the makers of scissors do to cause his previous boycott?
some people are just stupid...knealing with Kaepernick

My fellow Twitter snowflakes, let's piss off some Trump supporters. Post a picture of you proudly wearing stuff!

Shares of Nike fell 3% today as calls for of the sportswear giant gained traction on social media after selecting Colin Kaepernick as face of the 30th anniversary Just Do It slogan.
All you cats might want to hold a and vote for people who know what they're doing. I'd wager that's probably the best way to support the troops.
I continue to support Colin Kaepernick and the fight against police violence. I also support the boycott of Nike. F*ck Nike for exploiting Colin's efforts for profits and for horrible treatment of their workers.
About to buy some just because.
Let's not omit the point that has been paying Colin Kaepernick all along. They just went public with this new ad campaign. I asked what he sacrificed and I haven't been told what was sacrificed yet.
To the Americans supporting the , I run in Pegasus size 8.5. Instead of burning them rather donate to my charity.Thanks in advance.

Try and find a charity, cause, anything Kaepernick was involved in pre-photo-op. Nothing. Funny how no one can Take a Knee for the "cause" at any other time except football games.
Stop using me, my , & the service of millions of other in your petty bullshit "political" tantrums. Do something besides destroying useful articles of clothing that people would gratefully use: donate it, you petulant children.
Is anybody burning there and tickets message me i can put it to better use thank you
Im just going to end with this:Its easy to be blinded by privilege but always remember that just because something doesnt affect you doesnt mean that it doesnt happen nor does it mean that you cant be empathetic.
I can't take anyone against kneeling seriously when our draft dodging president has disrespected the flag and our veterans way worse than someone wanting to put police brutality and misconduct in the spotlight
JUST DO IT!
Dear Nike: Colin Kaepernick didn't sacrifice 'everything,' and it wasn't for a good cause
Paint US flags on their shoes first and watch the dilemma fry their brains. Outrage "patriotism" is a joke. Don't listen to the stokers of outrage. Fascism begins with fear turned to hate. All I'm boycotting is useless outrage.
Anyone supporting the and feel the need to purge with some 95s, Jays or AF1s - LMK... especially if they are W10.5/M9 - posting for a friend.
People say didnt sacrifice keep missing the point and are personal and shouldnt be criticized, guess the mom of three who worked 2 jobs to put food on the table didnt sacrifice because she didnt enlist to fight either
chose to get political. So we boycotted them and bought for our kids back to school shopping. It sucks because Ive been buying forever.
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme Court It's also fun how moron white liberals think no black person born in the UK uses UK spelling... are we not real blacks then?
Yall remember when people were hoing to buy all the NWA CDs and merchandise just to burn them and destroy them in the street? Remember what Eazy E said. He dont give a damn what did with them after they bought it. Still money in his pocket
Dear Nike, we applaud your view of supporting Colin Kaepernick and respect your courage of standing strong even against popular opinion. Best wishes Addias and UA
The is a sad attempt at... whatever it is they are attempting.Do the same boycotters know the full lyrics to Star Spangle Banner? Probably not.Do the same boycotters assist homeless Vets more than 3 times a year? Nope.So how are they a better American?
HERE is how you "JUST DO IT"
all these people boycotting Nike for supporting but not one of them are boycotting the Catholic church
Nike, the kings of sweatshops and child labor, are the darlings the liberals today. The irony is hilarious. I havent bought Nikes for years because of employee abuse but now I should support them because of Colin Kaepernick is the face of their brand? Gtfo

They're just shoes, people. A company made a decision based on a trendy topic. It's not like they're bringing back New Coke.
BAD BUSINESS DECISION!! Let that stock plummet, and theyll pull the plug on lucky ! , Hey Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan, looks like yall can go make Reebok the new shoe giant!!
For everyone participating in the , lets do something positive at the same time. If you are burning or planning on burning Nike merchandise and clothes, I urge you not to. Instead donate the clothes! There are those who could use them!
Hey racist just leave your Nike gear on its gonna burn one day for you anyway.
I see this Nike thing as a moment to come together. Instead of burning your shoes, just trade them to a liberal. Then the liberal can give you shit they don't wanna be seen in like under armor or trade you that Jimmy John's gift card they got for the holidays.
My newsfeed usually only this lit when something crazy happens on .
you must purge yourself of all things not distilled to pure Trumpism.Burn everything you own to hurt Nike, evil NFL players and liberals.And record it. Nothing angers a liberal like seeing you destroy your own property.
Hey let's spend hundreds of dollars on merchandise and then burn it because we are sensitive to an ad. We will show them.
Next time someone asks I will boycott because of the situation. My response will be...

you have lost a customer for life.
Nike just even the game...

Apparently, some Americans are destroying their Nike apparel as part of some . The United States is a demented theme park.
Wow, looks like Pat Tillmans family doesn't want y'all using his memory to try to shit on Colin Kapernick. Can't stop shit from stinking tho, I guess.
Because your bullshit is laughable. To many help the Vets chest thumpers out here that do nothing but hide behind a faux News sound bite. Just do it!
So many talking about boycotting Nike. Has anyone stopped to think about the children in the factory in Thailand that got families to support?
If youre against instead of imma go buy more Nike! Why not just draw the swoosh on whatever clothing you happen to wear?
I honestly cant work out if this is real or surreal marketing genius.
That makes no sense. How toxic of person do you have to be to hate someone so much that you destroy your own shit because of their beliefs???
some of us live in the now. the other half still live in the past.
Hey , Veteran here, just asking you got these in purple? The only thing I'm cutting off my nikes is the new tags.
If yall really that upset w/ & support the troops go volunteer at a va hospital or in order to fight mental health issues and homelessness. Burning your nike apparel isnt supporting service members like me or vets. Yall just want attention

So you gave Nike money and decided to burn them. Why not donate to a cause? I notice nobody is not burning anything of value. See you at Foot Locker when the new Air Max comes out
US Soldiers are hero's. Not Colin Broughtup by white supremacy adopted parents. Just Do Do It! !
they're just angry, insecure people. that simple.
My way of boycotting exploiting Pat Tillmans tragic death to support their stupid I made a donation to the Pat Tillman Foundation which NFL supports. I made it in HONOR OF for supporting equality and kneeling for injustice. Keep shining Colin!
Must Watch.Sad horrible history untold
2/ "Diversity" is not doing the exact same thing that people complain about but in a reverse scenario. Cut it out Ulta.
The same people that are going to are the same people who thought it was Ok that war hero John McCain was disrespected.
we luv always have. Were in full support of what they stand for. knew exactly what he was doing. Theyre to blind to see the light .
End of the day got PR like never before. Brilliant marketing to use social injustice.
For people upset about Nike yall do know that they already got your money. So you cutting out the symbol doesnt hurt them. It just makes you look like a bum who is ruining their own property. Just an observation.
Just Done!
I have not purchased Nike in 30 years - mainly do to the fact that most items are not made in USA- But the fact that Nike has decided to elevate a national hero - Colin Kaepernick- I will reconsider and start purchasing Nike. FUCK the
Nike is the greatest sports brand in the world but their Marxist bias is way too obvious.
I will never buy another product ever, there are so many other alternatives that are just as good that come without the political BS.
. contracts are typically reserved for athletes. Colin Kaepernick's contract is exclusively for politics not sports, specifically Democrat politics. Should the FEC force Democrats to recognize Nike's new Just Do It campaign as a DNC donation?
I am cool with the because that means I get to buy their stock at a discount. Go ahead racists and boycott. Boycott damnit! I'm a black person looking to build generational wealth with discounted stock.
If you are supporting the and have any of these sneakers in a size 7 1/2, size 8 or heck even a size 9. I'll make it work inbox me for details. Bless

Isn't the nowadays? Out of date? This is a hailmary having become their spokesperson. Which is funny because it's tanking because of and will only be hailmarying in church.
So supports a guy that wears socks like this? Policemen are no pigs, they are heroes. I will save a lot of money, because I won't buy jerseys till Nike fires this guy.
People were all about companys expressing their support when chic-fil-a did it. Now Nike is doing the same thing and the same people are losing their minds
Haven't seen one person in actual workout gear burning their Nike stuff. Maybe because there's a correlation between the and being a lazy p.o.s.?
Everyone whos big mad and participating in the , I want to say thank you because my chances of getting exclusive sneakers just went up because some of yall are racists as fuck.
gonna sponsor next?Just Don't Do it! !
They trying to form a boycott over a person they dont like. So that says a lot. Theyre apart of the problem in America. They want these cops abusing the system as long as its not their family. is real, theyll see when it hits their doorstep.

Hey your Trump National Golf Club proudly sells Nike products. (Screen shot from Trump National website below.) Wonder how your base is going to feel about that given they are burning Nike products because Colin Kaepernick is in their new ad?!
What a shame, I used to love buying products, not anymore.
...Ive just placed an order and working towards my next
I was really pleased to see many of the players who knelt and disparaged our anthem and flag working hard during the offseason to raise awareness for the cause they feel so strongly for...oh wait
All this shit is ridiculous! How about boycotting the young black men being killed for no reason boycott that shit! Kap stood for what he believed in and thats wrong?
I'm gonna fuck up all the clothes I already gave you my money for because fuck you.
Before burning new shoes, please make a research about who made them first and if you still dont want them, think about who might need them. Human beings already waste precious resources as it is, stop this stupid and just dont buy shoes.
Support a traitor...lose your support
I wish everyone was just as outraged over the Catholic Church covering up and basically excusing kid fucking as they were about Nike and Kaep. Every Catholic Church should be set ablaze along with all the Chomos.
Former Iranian president Ahmadinejad bemoaned that Kaepernick will not play in the NFL. Nike and Ahmadinejad perfect together
Ahmadinejad: " I will now outfit all my death squads with in support of ! He, like me, hates the great Satan - the USA - he refuses to stand for the Anthem of Evil." Death to all who ! "**Sarcasm
I have literally seen only three pics the same three pics over and over and this proves all republicans are burning their Nikes. Not. Sure aint buying no more though.
White people are more upset about Colin Kaepernick being the face of Nike than they were when Trump said John McCain wasnt a hero because he was captured, even though Trump avoided being drafted, more than ONCE. How patriotic...
Ahmadinejad: " I will now outfit all my death squads with in support of ! He, like me, hates the great Satan - the USA - he refuses to stand for the Anthem of Evil." Death to all who ! "**Sarcasm
if I had the money to spare, I'd buy a shit ton of Nike shoes just to give the in . What would you do to support ?
. Some of those that burn Jordans, are the same that burn crosses.

For our Veterans and those who have served our Flag, I am doing a NIKE clothing and apparel donation drive. Stop by me (or message) to donate and/or send in your donation pictures! Take this as another opportunity to celebrate and honor the heros in our communities.
Nike knows that the racist Trump supporting base isn't good for business. Indicated by Ivanka Trumps clothing line shutting down not too long ago.
and have left me nostalgic, for my teenage years, my button fly 501's and my men's Cortez's size 5 cause Im a girl, well was a girl. These companies are woven into the American fabric, can't kill heroes! ? I have a better idea, !
to my point from earlier ... means nothing to Nike. It just makes their core customer that much more loyal.
only temporary as they know its means better business long termmeanwhile the rest of the world is having a good laugh
How are all these fools going to be able to stand for the national anthem when their feet hurt because they burnt all their comfy sneakers?
From a cousin who's best friend was killed in Afghanistan. RT!
the logo upside down and add a cross line. Just Do Do it!
just bought a pair of nike's yesterday support nike no matter what the cost
The cool thing about the is that it won't do anything because we as consumers have literally zero power over corporations.
Is really a thing?! Dont we have better things to do like, I dont know, maybe start with not burning our clothes! Global Warming is a real thing! Give your clothes the poor. They dont care who is promoting what, they just want to stay warm.
Cow milking horse riding cousin fuckin crackers
I see alot of people using pictures of wounded veterans and veterans who have made the ultimate sacrifice as part of the . I really hope they got the veterans permission or that of their families before politicizing their sacrifice.
Kaepernick isnt AGAINST the military. He is AGAINST the mistreatment of People of Color. If you really want to support the military, DONATE those Nikes to a homeless veteran shelter instead of burning them
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme CourtThank you white liberal for telling us po' ignorant black folk who we're supposed to speak, think and act! What would we do without you?
My new Nike kicks just because... and I SUPPORT supporting can kiss my ass!!!
Theyre just shoes. Relax yall
If you are going to burn your goods because of the ad campaign, dont. Donate them to charity instead and do some good.
Just burned your shoes that some people desperately need?Congratulations, you are the worst example of humanity amongst us!
I would just love someone to tell me what Kaepernick sacrificed? He didnt start kneeling till he got benched!
SUPPORT NIKE IF YOU LOVE PISSING OFF OVER PATRIOTIC STUPID AMERICANS USUALLY HILLBILLIES AND RED NECK JESUS FREAKS..FUCK THE ANTHEM AND THE FLAG WHEN BLACKS ARE BEING MURDERED BY A FEW RACIST TRUMP LOVING PIG POLICE.....
America gave you an opportunity everyone in the world would die for, but you took it for granted and spat on her face. A fool, an ingrate, a national disgrace who does not believe in the best idea in the human history that is America...
Boycotting In and Out because they donated to Republicans is the stupidest thing ev.... Hold my beer, I need to go burn some Nikes.
This whole situation just isn't worth my time.
JUST DO IT The amount of people who seem to have good walking around sense has been cut in half today. Just saying...
Being Fake mad is the worse thing to happen in 2018 Everybody saying but will never stopping buying their apparel....Just like how yall was Fake mad & once hating with no understanding became trendy I knew it was a wrap yall make me sick
Honestly, I don't get the . I had no problem with kneeling, though he shouldn't have worn the Pigs socks. We shouldn't be mad about an injustice being brought to light in a peaceful fashion.
I just ordered a tshirt with a huge-ass logo across the front. And I usually don't ever wear logos.
Buyers scoop up on temporary dip and drive stock to new highs on wonderful news.Just kidding. They're struggling to keep the stock above key support before the bottom falls out.
Im NEVER buying nike again, I will support our troops and all THEY have sacrificed till the day I die.
Wearing all today. Nike SB hat with the matching Nike SB Dunks with the Nike socks and the Nike SB USA Jersey. Don't make me take off my Nike belt and whoop some ass!
I've been doing my own for YEARS. Ever since they were the only group that wouldn't cancel Michael Vick's contract after he was busted for his dog fighting ring/Bad Newz Kennels. They're both shit, IMHO.
Boycotting a company that abuses their employees is good.But:1. Don't do it because of the commercial2. Don't waste shoes, just don't buy anymore new ones from that brand
I wear a size 14, just saying

Nike Takes a Knee Loses $3.75 Billion in Market Cap After Colin Kaepernick Named Face of 'Just Do It'
Racists will boycott for making a black man the face of its company, but remain silent on the Catholic church covering up sexual abuse.
Me parece bien que algunos americanos furiosos con Nike quemen sus productos. Ten√≠an un p√©simo gusto
remember Nike dont like real Americans or the flag. They prefer to disrespect our country.
When I say I hate people, shit like this justifies it. How anyone could agree with Trump's view on the whole Kaepernick situation is beyond belief as it is, people on board with this need setting on fire themselves
Taking donations from anyone who cant handle justice for black and brown people
Nike Shut The Hell Up. "Just Do It"
Nike learns a very hard financial lesson. Leave politics and religion at the front door of your business. Everyone's money is green. Why would you make such a stupid business decision. Your CEO should be fired immediately.
PSA: The Is honestly ridiculous and its a shame that that is what it comes down to in stead of looking at the true message is trying to give. I support
I'm sick and tired of white male vets thinking they are the ONLY ones whose service to country matters; that they are the ONLY ones entitled to define or opine about patriotism. Stand down. You are arrogant fools who dishonor that flag more than those you accuse .
I can't believe nike....i just threw away about 700.00 worth of Nike products...ill never buy again
Oh hey thank you for stirring up another controversy to help continue the divide in our country. Propagating hate on both sides. Good call! got people really hating out here on both sides.
Kaepernick is awful. Directly because of NIKE choosing cop-hating Kaepernick, the DOW slashed today's losses but is still in the red.
Well someone got the and confused.
Wait. So people mad because supports a man who had the courage to stand up to Police Brutality and not mad because their inherent racism just caused them to burn their own shit? is just gonna help sell more shit
I dont support . Im suggesting an alternative for burning/ not wearing Nike, thats all.
Just released: Air Kaepernicks
Not burning my Nikes but I did just order new sneakers from another brand. Not walking around wearing a company thats choosing someone who doesnt support our police as their face
I don't know about yall bout I'm going buy some nike today and use my military discount. Bag em up
doesnt give a frogs fat ass if yous are burning your shoes. Money already in their pockets. You losers are dramatic as fuck. Proud to support and the campaign
World:Youre wrong! All of these American bigots and racists arent destroying and disposing of their products in response to the campaign and some . Theyre just making room for the Spring/Summer KKK Robe Line...
America, where you can burn thousands of shoes, jerseys and clothing products for likes on social media instead of donating them to a good cause. I love this country!
So let me get this straight, instead of donating your Nike items to homeless vets who youve been using as scapegoats for your racism... youre burning them? Okay makes sense.
is no hero or role model. He's not a victim & not making a sacrifice.He is just a lousy reject who lost his skill, now looking for attention, sympathy & a payday. just f&cked up.
There are so many people who live without shoes in the United States. If you're filled with rage at a sneaker company, donate the shoes you can't bear to wear.
Whose ever idea it was to sign as the face of 's new ads should get a raise because he/she is a straight genius! You can boycott all you want cuz Nike is laughing all the way to the bank with this one!
Investing in a new pair of Vomeros not only because I love the shoe, but because I love what the current campaign is saying. No for this runner!
Hey you should replace Mickey Mouse w ? That would give and the guys LOTS 2 Debate?
Good thing I love my Bounce shoes cause Ill never own another bit of gear. And I used to love Nike. Guess all my Panthers apparel will be another brand now!
STOP BLINKING AND SUPPORT THE TROOPS
They lost my business.
naaaaa we will only support the if those doing the boycotting match your donations in giving back to the community since 2011....they won't.....
Get the fuck over it and go wear your instead is stoopid AF. is the rep and I support
has always had outrageous pricing on all their products. If Im going to spend any money Ill buy Adidas. Better product, better pricing, and better judgement...
I want all the racist white folks to come on out now and quit hiding u know u gone still buy Nike idk y u lying for on here trying to get retweets u know u r u jus mad cuz they behind kapernick it's ok white supremacists come on out so we can know who u r
What is this all about? Im confused as hell
Skip the and send that shit straight to the dump! The has inspired me to get rid of my socks and sneakers just like my Keurig and . Not gonna spend my money on that filth anymore
Can I fully support Colin Kaepernick while also knowing that Nike is a vile company, and that their endorsement dollars come from slaves? Or is that too much cognitive dissonance for one brain to contain?
How about instead of setting your Nike stuff on fire, you donate it to a homeless shelter or underprivileged youth... something actually useful.

The same people who are down with the are the same people who want to send Mexican Americans "back home", all the while eating at restaurants where people from Mexico and Central America are cooking and preparing their meals.
I would find an old pair of Nikes to burn for the memes with this dumb thing trending, but than I remembered I don't have any cause Nikes are shit.
I don't own a pair of Nikes, but I probably will soon. I used a black marker to put a check mark on my old tennies to wear til then.
How to turn the country against you in a pathetic excuse for an ad campaign. Congrats ya just did it the only product youll be selling are knee pads
When Americans boycott, they just dont buy certain things When magats boycott, they destroy shit
Because I was feeling left out and wanted to get in on the ...I went out and bought a pair of Adidas golf shoes this afternoon and they are spectacular.
Reading all these post about ppl burning their Nikes over their new add is crazy..if yall are gonna do that why dont yall donate them to your local homeless shelter instead..a lot of good ppl could use them
This joke is played out, but if you're burning your shoes, hold off. I'm a size 12 and could use some kicks. Show what's what by thrifting shoes. Btw is a bitch who got paid to virtue signal, but burning Nikes looks petty.
Re: Umm.. I think just became the international uniform of
Btw, the women are finally seeing what the dems have been doing as well. Theyve used everyone as a victim and pitted us all against each other! I ain't going down like that!!! What about you???
I've seen and met many a and I had NO idea until yesterday that any of them owned ANY workout gear or apparel. Just waiting for the news story where some man in FL accidentally burns down his house while streaming his effigy.
Honestly, this is the most Ive heard about Nike, since the Shia lebouf JUST DO IT memes...
They already know that if you put me and my friends in the same class, it would be too lit
The best comment I've seen so far Old angry white guys are not a core demographic for Nike" Nike will be just fine.
I have no idea what people are expecting to accomplish with this . Racism in the US is as deeply rooted as corruption in the 3rd World and nothing is going to change that. I know Nike is laughing at this.
Stand up for what you believe in. Kneeling is for cowards. Nike burn pile by the fire pit in the back yard at my house tonight at 8 pm. Come join the fun, buy your kids new gear from a company that keeps their political views to themselves.
One of the Nike burning racists just said expecting fair treatment under the law for everyone is Marxist! So sad... the fight to keep racism and privilege has not ended! Voting matters!
I've got this conspiracy that there were some Nikes stored in that Brazilian Museum and the curator was a Trump supporter
I never met my grandfather! He was shot in the head execution style by a cop... Police brutality isnt a story or a myth in my house and family! Its real and when people misunderstand the reason for the kneel it is just mind blowing
Everyone is burning their Nike shoes & I'm just like "Nike rarely has them in my size (15) so when you guys are all crying about no longer having shoes, I'll be over here buying my New Balance shoes shaking my head in disapproval with you folks for making waste."
boycott because Colin Kaepernick is now the face. This really isnt looking good for nike.

This stuff is Hilarious. Keep it up
Any OG Yeezyz that anyone wants to burn, please dont I will take them and put them to good use.
Instead of burning and destroying Nike stuff. Why dont these people donate their things to homeless veterans out on the street? Since you know they care so much about our country...
really want to piss off Nike, Under Armour & Puma all at the same time. Never buy their products at Retail Prices, always go discount store. It's all overpriced sweatshop made goods marked up to inflated prices.
pssst... hey! yall wanna talk about activating base constituencies? because is currently holding a ridiculously public, unwittingly-bipartisan, masterclass on that very topic.
Nike are hitting home with these adverts I must say.
should be more concerned about the lives of our law enforcement officers and not market someone supporting a cop killer
Obviously, Nike didnt have to give a middle finger to millions of customers to retain and grow this market. You know, the soccer moms and dads who would have purchased these shoes will cost them millions.
Polled my undergraduate marketing students today (anonymous). 70% believe that ad campaign is a good marketing tactic (vs. bad); 87% feel it is a marketing opportunity (compared to a threat).
oh the possibilities just did it-without thinkingJust stepped in itJust don'tImmediately fire your idol and your marketing staff.Just idiots!
Looks like opportunity to me lets see how far it will drop before i buy .
Since they boycotting let us become an authorized dealer of Bike product.
The same dudes who say we can't afford to feed starving babies because we have homeless veterans here are setting brand new sneakers on fire instead of donating them to a homeless vet.
Yo if you're gonna burn your stuff just send it my way first k?Size 12 shoesSize XL shirt34" waistif it doesn't fit I will burn it for you
Phil Knight is also a part of The MLM and be sure to boycott them as well. They are also known as People United Reaching Everyone.
Hey you folks, why don't you donate your used gear to homeless vets or other homeless folks instead of just destroying them like petulant children? You claim to love vets,
Seems like Nike was able to hold their enthusiasm in check, by not unveiling their campaign until the nationwide school supplies shopping spree was over...
The (former) president of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad; infamous 'death to gays, Nazi Holocaust denier, imprisoner/raper of political dissidents has just signed on to Team Kaepernick

Here to all the people destroying their clothes in the . You could have donated them to people in need. You could have even given them to friends who could have used an extra shirt or two. But hey, someone has to keep the spirit alive.
We are getting a great opportunity as Americans and consumers to see where these blue chip companies loyalties really are. We will no longer surrender our country to the false song of globalism.
Actually, there is NOTHING correct about their leftwing, pc, BULLSH** path. I'm from now on.To align with this anti-American I got no use for them...
Youre sacrificing my and all my friends and familys businesss. Now adidas and under armors getting all of it!
So proud of I will always buy your products and thank you for not being a pushover company. I wouldn't worry about a - somehow I don't think a few rednecks can hurt your giant company.

Yall idiots burning Nike clothes shoes and ect because you think you know what Collin kapernick was fighting for not even really knowing has nothing to do with the flag or disrespecting veterans never has but yall think it is
Nike and Colin wants us to believe that his kneeling cost him everything? I'm sorry, he turned down a contract to play in Denver. He didn't lose everything, he said no to a job so he could continue his 'whoa is me' campaign
There would be no if they had used someone who ACTUALLY gave up EVERYTHING for his beliefs...
Thanks to the ,I Just ordered $562 worth of shoes!Go .
Cant believe the amount of melts from the US that are burning their Nike clothing.. its hilarious!

People! If you are going to boycott Nike, boycott Nike because they pay their workers in places like Indonesia $3.50 a day to make us sneakers and charge us $300. Not because they chose as the face of their 30th anniversary of Just Do it.
Breaking news on the : Turns out is going to be JUST FINE.
I don't usually discuss trending items but I find it appalling that there's more outrage about than there is about the of child sexual abuse!
I used to support but.... Im gonna continue supporting them because theyre a wonderful brand and support Colin.
This Nike boycott is way out of line. Yall really burning Nike products because of one person in the world. Wake the fuck up and realize whats really going on in the world. Yall some followers. We need more leaders.
I hope your stock hits rock bottom. You need to understand the difference between real sacrifice and using media/sports for your own political agenda.
Shitcan the blah blah rhetoric. If you're on the , just state that you're a racist. We all fucking know it.
Westboro Baptist church and Colon Kaepernick totally disrespect our country in their own, foolish ways. Colon, get a grip. You are also a bad football player. You clown.
is Trending in top 10 now in US. Visit for more such hot images
If your burning Nikes because of your feelings about Kapernick remember, you have to buy those shoes to burn. All faith in humanity is disappearing.
Re: Umm.. I think Nike just became the international uniform of
I keep seeing the same 3 pics. I don't think this is even real.
!....I dont even know who Colin Kaepernick. I just came for the drama.
As a Trump Supporter this whole Colin Kaepernick is getting ridiculous and Ill be the first one to say this I support Colin Kaepernick and Nike
I, too, would like to participate in this . As I don't own any Nikes, I would appreciate anyone sending those Nike's they would like to trash or burn so that I may dispose of them in solidarity. Sincerely, Me.

How stupid is it to burn/boycott for "disrespecting the military" by burning paid for clothes, when we literally have thousands of homeless vets, who NEED clothing?

Worst part about isnt just racists burning their already paid for products its all the toxic fumes and CO2 being added to the atmosphere. Youre tellling everyone youre racist AND hurting the earth in the process. Your president would be so proud of you.
Happy to see this country music singer mixing it up on about . Anything to keep him out of the studio

Shout out to the mooks burning and cutting up all their clothes using or to keep the brand name more popular than ever. No such thing as bad press.
To all those offended by I challenge you to live up to your words and donate gently used clothes/shoes to help Vets in need. Here is a good way to do so and is even tax deductible.
Its more civilians mad bout NiKE using Colin as the face for their 30 years anniversary but the gag is ITS EVEN MORE SOLIDERS ROOTING FOR HIM
The fact that people are getting so pissed off with and Colin Kaepernick makes me feel so much better about myself. This is the same thing that happened with , people are still going to be using them and forget about it in about 4 weeks.
Imagine if all this effort being put into boycotting Nike was used towards the ACTUAL problem... Side note: If any of you are planning on burning your shoes, Ill take any ladies size 8.5 and mens 11
This has been nothing but some brick shoes. I want at least one of y'all to be serious about this. Burn your retro Jordans, or your Off White Vapormaxes. Then we'll know you're deadass
If you guys are going to give up your Nike clothes/ shoes, I wear a large shirt and size 12 shoe. Just DM me and Ill give you my shipping address.
So "patriots" will start buying Sky Davis Air Jets now because of Kaepernick's knee? I know a lot of them who stand in line at Foot Locker on Saturday for Jordans.
Tim Tebow kneeled during the National Anthem because he was against abortion. No one batted an eye and said he was disrespectful towards the military and country. He didn't get blackballed and shunned by anyone. America is the land of hypocrites. Fuck the
Just think how much overtime pay those 7 year old factory workers will make once the backfires.

just do it
thanks for continuing the division that trump gets blamed for
"We need a because is disrespecting our troops." But none of y'all bitched when ol Trumplestilskin disrespected John McCain, an actual war hero. Stop using my service as an excuse for this war on common sense. I'm a veteran, and I'll kneel with Colin.
Colin wants 2 stand 4 something but yet he now represents sweat shops which are simply awful. So are you standing for something or just lookin 4 attention
Hey guys, a lot of these homeless veterans (whom y'all care so much about) would probably love to wear those Nike clothes/shoes you're destroying. So just donate 'em.
Take a good look at the type of people who are supporting this boycott. It's easy to see what kind of people they are.
does great art but this is disgusting
I understand and fully support the and to help all those outraged by Nikes support of Kaepernick, I will accept all Nike sneaker donations (size 10) and apparel (size large)
As if is a top trend in USA - how backwards are America
imo is a dumb idea to do. Nike is such a huge business that having 1 million people not buying their shoes wont affect them at all. Personally I dont like Nike shoes and have always preferred converse/vans yet having a boycott over a companys decision is retarded.
I need a tee shirt w CK just do it!!
Remember the outrage just over a year ago when the CEO of UA came out against Trump and everyone lost their $&? and said theyd boycott UA? Remember that? And now Nike? Soon the entire Trump base will be naked . Hypocrites.
The people who are boycotting Nike are the people who thinks America is equal, Nike just proved to you there is no equality amongst others by bringing light to a dark alley and watching the critters troll, actions speak louder than words
AP top 25 just released. And our take on Nike and Kaepernick.
So why do they have to burn up their own stuff? They should care more about the people in their communities.I know, it doesnt sound the same when I say it.
Apparently, all the and tRump supporters are engaging in a . So, they will throw a fit and burn all their paraphernalia and in a week they will go out and buy more in secret.
just do it
So just to be clear Kaep being the face of the Nike campaign is where Americans draw the line? It wasnt yalls President grabbing women by the ? It wasnt the NFL saying stand or stay in the locker room?Yet you draw the line at him being the face though

yike I rted some tweets not knowing what the issue was about and now my followers probably think Im racist, Im just gonna delete this account. Lmao I should really look into things next time
Instead of burning or destroying your gear, why not donate to people in need? Im sure there are plenty of people that would love to have some sneakers to wear, no matter what the brand. Just a thought.
Ill add my voice to this. Promoting an idiot like Kaepernick is a rediculous move.
To all those offended by I challenge you to live up to your words and donate gently used clothes/shoes to help Vets in need. Here is a good way to do so and is even tax deductible.
SO bad for Stockholders! I would no longer spend a penny of mine on Nike Apperal! The hypocrisy shown by Nike as they give millions to have their logo all over the NFL then basically turn and support a man directly in the face of the NFL. Pick a side Nike!!
.......you both just got followed. Keep up the SUPREME WORK. Just Do It!!!!!!
The is a conjob by one-hit wonder trying to reclaim some of his 15 minutes of fame.Shame that "Save a horse, ride someone that doesn't blindly support the GOP agenda." isn't as catchy as the song from the guy that wasn't good enough to be in Lonestar.
Make sure you buy stock while it falls because one think about the swoosh is their not going anywhere but back up guaranteed.
I want ya to keep that same energy when a hyped Nike release come out
Sorry Nike. You just lost a life long customer.
I think everyone wins in the and deal Nike appeals to the core audience and generates more revenue and Colin gets to use there platform to further speak out on social injustices
Wow this is crazy people reallyhate black people so much thatthey gonna stop buying Nike justbecause of Colin Kaepernick smh
Listen if you have some size 15 Nike's and you in this whole i'm just letting you know i have a cleaner way of disposing them so just DM me and let me know so i could help you not pollute :)
Looking forward to buying my first apparel in 20 plus years.
I am so happy to check out the looking for people on my timeline that are supporting this absurd, stupid and, frankly, backfiring hashtag.All I found was people laughing at them. I love my timeline
y'all ppl are the devil's children.. why come at this like a dis to your privileged lives.. you don't want blacks to stand up for anything huh?..an we buy most of Nike products why not support our cause. police brutality is gotta fuckin stop you a**holes
You all can just send me your Nike stuff. Size 8 shoes and medium for clothes. Thx!
Instead of destroying clothes you already paid for, why dont you donate them to homeless vets??? But yall to busy being dummies. But that's none of my business
Be like Nike and Just Do It.
11/ is trending on Twitter following the company's decision to make Kaepernick the face of its latest "just do it" campaign. The company had lost four billion in market cap since Friday's close as of this writing.
whoa, whoa, whoa i was working & just learned that some americans are burning their nikes because of the amazing, powerful, necessary and needed ad campaign. I can only assume means boycott the asshats who are burning their nikes
Cutting out the logo isn't as hilarious as the keurig coffee machine boycott.
We look back at white people who were hateful towards Jackie Robinson in disgust. We question how anyone could think that way... 70 years later, we repeat history. How will the future generations regard us?
Instead of BURNING yall stuff, could yall just DONATE it ... least make it purposeful at the same time. Yall being wasteful and could be helping people through yall misdirected hate
okay so apparently people are burning their nikes (not me lol some of us cant afford new shoes) but like WHY
Ridiculous conservatives who are pissed at when they throw away perfectly good shoes are like toddlers who throw away food when something doesnt go their way. Those shoes could have went to a homeless veteran.
for the boycott you have liberals calling for boycotting of In and out restaurants because you don't like that they made a donation to the GOP, and you liberals are going to whine about what others chose to boycott over, that is really funny.
yall Im so confused I know Colin was in their new ad but why are people are so genuinely pissed off at it ?
10 Reasons to REFUSE to Stand for the National Anthem
Going to school shoeless tommorow, cause Nike is all I have.
People have the nerve to be mad because a well known shoe brand is backing a black man whos speaking against racism. Pathetic.
Nike is projecting to lose $12.43 over the boycott due to Colin Kaepernick featured in latest Nike ad. Ok so while you guys are burning shoes to support Vets as my Dad & many relatives are, try DONATING your NIKE to them instead!
I just bought a new pair of Nike shoes.
Of course! All the people Ive seen destroying their Nike clothes have been white men. You refuse to understand why athletes truly kneel. You only want to believe its disrespectfully vets. Take those perfectly good clothes/shoes and donate to vets in need.
Political associations mean nothing here. Citizens who respect the majority of those officers in service don't want to support Kaepernick! Hence why he doesn't play football! Why on earth Nike did this is beyond me! It is almost like publicity against the police
Much respect to Brenda Murph for staying so classy while being viciously attacked by the left. These hypocrits have no class. Rush to support Nike who's sneekers are made in sweat shops by women and children at 20 cents a hour all while paying Kap millions.
Youre all freaking out about Nike and boycotting it. Lets just be clear- Nike wont lose sleep over the one pair of shoes you buy each year.Nike will however benefit from your reposting their add.
I just left a seven person gangbang, all males. We all had our Nike shoes on, it was a hell of a time. The bottom was wearing Adidas.
For the people who are really participating in the just remember that America was built on a racist foundation and brutality towards minorities has been happening for decades
well since you decided to hire an anti American to sell your product I will not buy or support any athlete that wears your logo.
Let's just say is growing tomorrow.
Just did it. Bought Nikes bumper sticker on eBay. Will be on my car in 2 days.
Just so I'm clear, Kaepernick signed an endorsement deal because of his proactive stance against oppression with a company that knowingly oppresses their workers. Got it.
why would Nike alienate half of its customers! dumb move Nike! keep out of politics and Nike would have done just fine! now failure can be seen in the future!
AWESOME!! I LOVE NIKE. JUST BOUGHT A FRESH NEW PAIR
Burning stuff that people who actually need it could use. Genius.......
To all those offended by I challenge you to live up to your words and donate gently used clothes/shoes to help Vets in need. Here is a good way to do so and is even tax deductible.
Trends On Twitter: Colin Kaepernick Named Face Of Nike ‚ÄòJust Do It Campaign |¬†PeopleTV
Best part about is every Sunday when theyre wearing theirfootball team jersey they are wearing the brand that support Kaepernick, yall aint getting rid of him
To everyone who is too busy to burn their apparel, Ill be more than happy to shoot you my info. You can just mail everything you want burnt to my address and Ill take it from there. Thanks in advance!
has nothing to worry about; their line isnt sold at Walmart so they wont be losing too many customers.
it makes no sense to burn the shoes you already bought, Nike has the money. Just dont but their junk from this day forward!
trending just shows the amount of slew foot ass racism we deal with on the daily
dont burn your Nike stuff, just give it to me plz and thx
Take a look at this guys page. Hes now threatening to sue people for being mean to him because of his idiot move. Oh, and he says he might just go ahead and get his feet amputated.... Hes crazy!! He did this to himself.

Dearest: The appeared to get confused today during the they were marching around n circles shouting "SHOES will not replace us"! Its apparent, they forgot what the war was abt. retired to nearest for a frappe. Home soon!
I'm thinking about writing a piece on the Nike situation and how much of a strategic and culturally historic move it will prove to be over the next decade. Nike is a MAJOR influence on our youth. Will other corporations follow and, just do it?

Motherfuckers are more outraged about sneakers than a goddamn traitor in the White House.
This is hilarious! Yall boycotting for what exactly? Show me the burning Jordans and $75 pullover dryfit..yall out here burning cheap shit yall got at Ross...
For everyone in on the I just read s net worth is 110.3 billion dollars. That is all.
You assholes better donate your Nike shit. Seriously. You're pathetic and whiney if you destroy it or burn it when you could literally clothe someone. Be better with your rage. Build with it at least.
For any1 burning their Nike socks, tag us in the vids and pics and use . If >100 people participate well send the best vid/pic a pair of each of our 1st editions socks. Worth $125+. If no one notices this, its expected since no one follows us!
??? This society is SAD man. Just sad. I'm not boycotting NIKE. I get paid to buy from NIKE...
My favorite thing about the is that everyone just assumes the people boycotting are white racists.
mano, ou tem uns bot idiota me seguindo ou sei l√°, apareceu 2 pessoas que nem tem seguidor vindo me falar merda por causa do , tenho medo desse tipo de coisa, a internet ta foda.
Loyalty.Nike stood and stands by Serena Williams.Now, Nike stands by Colin Kaepernick.And some have decided to burn their Nike apparels for the support for Colin via .... Misplaced priorities.|SW, CK, NIKE.
Next time a company pulls a Colin Kpearnick amma short that stock with all the margin I can muster... watch me
You people are fools. The stocks in Nike aren't falling because of Kaepernick. Puma and Adidas stock are also falling (more). It's likely because of Trump's trade negotiations. ain't working
B-level country star (who doesn't even have the conviction to cut up his own clothes, you notice) says millions support racism-based police brutality.
They won't donate shit y cause they don't care about poor ppl or the less fortunate hell they could care less about your vets
Wait wait wait. Im all confused now. I thought we were the snowflakes?

If you want to get rid of your to take part in the , consider donating them to some Boys & Girls Clubs, , or shelters in the area. Same with shirts, socks, etc. Thanks!
Nike and Kap are a disgusting disgrace
This thing is really confusing, even after I did some background reading on it.
Yooo people are really burning their because of sheeeesh! people are sooo dumb
The fact that is number 1 trend on Twitter is huge publicity-wise. Most of the tweets I've seen using the hashtag are praising Nike.Also its a 10 year agreement, not a 24-hour one. The thing about stocks is the value can go up as well as down.
imagine the level of white privilege you have to exhibit to burn and cut perfectly good clothing/shoes instead of donating it to the homeless/displaced vets you use to push your false patriotic narrative and the millions of homeless children in your own country.
If Black people fall for this obvious exploitation of our unfortunate over commercialism & materialism with Woke commercialism for profit, then Negroes who support this deserved to be looked at and treated as the dumbest people in the world.
Dear all the idiots burning their clothing why nit just donate it to a homeless charity or a veterans charity seeing has all you want is to respect your flag why not help those who defended it
Just another appeal on the : If you are intent on burning your Nike gear, PLEASE donate it. There are so many homeless men, women, & children without.
Both sides of this argument have been absolutely hilarious
To all those burning your shoes, clothes, etc... Please, pause and think before you burn. With proper approval - you can donate your Nike gear to me directly pending confirmation I want it. Please DM me for details
Yall folks just need to donate ya shyt the less fortunate. They will use I.T. I never understood where this burning the merch thing

Today I found out a homeless woman died from heat stroke and everyone (almost) is her prayers and saying she was a fixture in downtown Harrisburg? The fuck? Plus grown man lights himself on because of Colin and Nike? today is day and fuck em.
Conservatives who call the left snowflake are the same ones calling for the boycott of Nike, Starbucks, Hamilton, Meryl Streep, ABC, Nordstrom, Delta and any brand that dares to stand for something they despise. Yeah, who are the real snowflakes again?
All this talk just shows you how much black people are still hated in America
It's not about whether or not you represent a worthy cause - it's all about whatever issue the social media trolls want to fit it into.
The only customers Nike is going to lose are the ones wearing these.
Under ArmourJUST DO IT!
My budget for athletic apparel and shoes runs in the $1000 per year range. Some years its twice that. Most of it usually Nike.Now, zero will go to Nike and most of it will go to retailers that do not rep Nike or have Nike swoosh in their store.
Fuck Y'all who do the , I will buy some soon. And I'm not a fan of them (not my type of sneak), but I sure love some Chuck Taylor (same company).
people boycotting Nike...how about instead of trashing your merch, you donate it to the thousands of homeless veterans that this country does nothing for?
Anyone looking to unload ANY Nike x Off Whites because of the boycott please give them to me. I will gladly wear them in shame
Nike got these folks burning their shoes because Kaepernick
maybe the maga idiots can use their shoes to build the wall instead of throwing them in the fire? How's that for an idea from the crowd? Or are just SO against using them for any purpose, you just wanna burn the shit you paid for because you love america so much?
I know this guy who threw his Calvin Klein boxers in the bin when Justin Bieber started appearing in their ads.
Before some of you start losing your minds and start posting videos and pics of you burning your Nike gear, why dont you do something positive with it and donate it to a homeless shelter or another good cause?
You know when you're a kid & someone on the other team got hurt you'd all take a knee until they were able to get off the court/field? What if wasn't only kneeling for injustice but for all the fallen soldiers that have sacrificed their lives for our country?
Most of you are fakes, I will not attend nor support as long as they contract with Destroyed logo now anti American and POLICE You fakes rationalize your hypocrisy
? Just do it.
Dear White People participating in the ,I don't need new sneakers/ apparel but I'm sure there are people out there who do. There are people just outside of your door needing warm clothes for the upcoming winter.
People are saying that they made Nike stock drop just a little bit hoping supporters start buying Nike stock so it rises. Then the people boycotting will dump their stock making it drop & make supporters lose a lot more money. We can't let this happen.
Look it here. Looks like stock had a sudden drop. Nike is supporting who is disrespectfully our anthem, flag, nation and police force.
I went out and bought 3 pairs of Nike shoes just so I can go back tomorrow and tell them exactly why I am returning them.
All you people burning your Nike stuff are really stupid and have nothing else to do but burn up shit you bought with your own money. Id like to see Apple support Kaepernick and see if yall would burn up your iphones.
This sux because the only athletic shoes Ive bought for years was ; now on to !
we‚Äòre boycotting Nike because by them supporting Colin Kaepernick they are somehow disrespecting the flag. We all know this isnt true but a big part of our population will continue to seek division over unity.
I just went to the Store and got my granddaughter her first pair of Nikes. Shes my
LMFAO imagine throwing away/burning your nike gear because youre too ignorant to understand why nike has chosen such an insperational person to represent their modern-thinking brand. At least donate it.
Like the premise Nike, just not the face
For everyone boycotting Nike just give me the clothes idgaf its cute ima wear I.T lol
Nike and NFL, losing money together pushing social justice by millionaires, if you drink koolaid you need to pay the price
CK just did it. Just told the mother of a fallen US Marine HE sacrificed everything. Can you say narcissism? and LeBron, Serina think it's great.
Whites over making The Face Of Nikes ‚ÄòJust Do It 30th Anniv. Campaign is not surprising, it is a reflection of their disdain for Black lives as a whole. Making it about the disrespecting the is only deflection & denial -
The shoes and clothing I purchased for the kids outfits have been returned. Will not support any company that doesn't STAND for America
Where the hell was the when they where abusing workers ? Thanks for playing
In honor of , I wore a Nike t-shirt & flip flops ANDordered a CUSTOMIZED NIKE t-shirt from w/Number 7 and the name "KAEPERNICK". I can't wait for it to arrive!And when Nike starts making gear, I'll be buying that too!
I hope you guys do . Because Ill be sending a P.O Box address for all the discarded Nike Gear. Nike expensive and Ill be sporting them for a while after this! Im a VETERAN and I support and . PS- It was never about the military
To idiots actually boycotting Nike: just go back to your trailer with your knock off crocs and 30 rack of natty light and continue to beat your wife and kids and complain of people of color and immigrants taking your job while you enjoy foodstamps and unemployment
I dont agree with hating groups because of individuals. Not all cops are racist and not all football players are narcissists. Either way, Nike is trying to profit on hate and division. Im not buying it
Hates Police & support Asian sweatshops! -10
What's everyone's problem with ? I'm confused? I think I've missed something??
Im not taking this serious !Them crack as wanted us to get over s**t ssssoooooo bad && now that Kap came out on top they got so much noise to make.
I have no time for racists and their . Im too busy shopping! !
I approve this , but I also believe that you¬¥re just boycotting yourself. You¬¥ve already spent your money on Nike though.
Heres an idea for everyone burning your Nike gear why dont you donate it there are tons of homeless veterans that could use what youre destroying and thats who youre supporting
Support Promote Vote out (at least the ones who dont go to jail
Trump should come out with Trump Sneakers. He'd make a killing since all of his supporters are burning their shoes. And it would create jobs... in China.
I've never been a fan of Nike. They have abusive and exploitative business practices. Granted I buy NFL jerseys and one I own is .. I support their decision to support him.
While I don't wear Nike it's not about any stupid , it's because they use leather in their shoes. If they make a vegan shoe I'm interested (like icats, converse Vans, Adidas etc. do)But yeah burn your shoes, that will... um.. show them?
If you burn your pair of , the only thing you proved is that you are a wasteful, useless, shit of a person. Congrats on that.
Yo I dont give a fuck about Nike supporting someone who kneeled and I dont give a fuck if your dumbass wanna burn $100 pairs of shoes imma still wear this dri fit
Yeah yall w ya arms up in the air over this is funny to me. makes the best apparel idc if they hurt your precious little feelings cause of Kaep
Thank you for showing us that we can achieve anything if we just believe and put the time and effort towards it even if the challenge looks to impossible
Friendly reminder that everyone wanted the wife and mother of Pat Tillman to sit down and shut up too. Quit using his death as a prop for hate!
For when you don't understand that a rich, half white millionaire is not the face of oppression. And for when you don't care about the racist sweatshops uses.
Im an Army Veteran and I think this handle is ridiculous. If you really want to support Veterans, please donate to homeless veterans instead. Or take an extra step and give those unwanted Nike gear to shelters where its needed.
See the thing about that I like the least about is the incredible amount of insecure white dudes making my enormous dick go soft. I don't like it when my dick goes soft.
Done....about to return all the shoes I just bought....
Brett Kavanaugh leaves his house with an Adidas bag
Im not participating in the because of Kaep... I just personally dont like Nike anymore. But phew, thats a tough business decision by Nike.
Colin has been benched by Nike. They just highjacked this whole campaign! Nike is the new face of Anti-patriotism!
Nike's ad with Colin Kaepernick is proof that taking a knee in sports more rewarding than if done in the White House.
Ive been needing new workout shoes, so what a perfect opportunity to buy some new Nikes.
The same people part of the are probably the same ppl who donated money to George Zimmerman go fund me account
nunca gostei dessa marca mesmo kkkk, ali√°s nunca nem usei essa bosta de t√™nis, boicoto desde a campanha da consolidated skateboards ''Don't do It'' unica coisa que esse t√™nis tem √© pre√ßo.
"just do it" by . Promoting rabid animals should be outlawed.
Y'all are just racists that's it.
Maybe Nike should have used Pat Tillman instead of Colin Kaepernick.
I love Nikes and recently bought a pair. I might just buy another. Thank you Nike!
Trumo supporters: We should stand for the flag and respect it
stock dropping, folks out here burning their Nike apparel, celebrities bad mouthing Nike. All because of who they made the face of their new ad campaign. Y'all still clueless to why was kneeling in the first place?
Because burning Nike's is much less obvious than burning crosses.
Bogus Outrage dude
These people are the definition of hypocritical and delusional.
Frustrated!!!!! HELP ME PLAYING THIS GAME!!!!! Android: iOS: AP Poll Furniture Row Racing
Just a minor clapback in the face of racism.
This is ridiculous. These racist Caucasians refuse to acknowledge the reason why he knelt and just focus on the disrespect to the flag.
the fact that people are supporting and how nikes sales have dropped just shows EXACTLY what we needed to see. This isnt about him kneeling yeah rite the fact that nike is advocating for colin a colored man standing for his people is what people are pissed about.
Btw all you peeps, don't forget to burn those Chuck Taylor's cause owns those too!!
is ridiculous. Grow up, USA. Seriously, grow up.
Covered why lost his job and can't get a new one ... last year. He was SACKED in because of terrible play & attitude. .
fuck this boycott bullshit. I love Nike. I cant stand how some people here that turn a blind eye when a racial issue is discussed or any type of activism to stop it. Low life cowards. I support and .
What ? Just bought me a fresh pair.
REALLY? You chose ?? Just do it, boycott Nike!
Now just appearing like you care is good enough. Ppl still mortgage their future, sad that it's as cheap for likes and popularity...2/
you dont support standing for our flag - Im not supporting your product anymore
Is a new thing , Iv boycotted it for about 10 years not because of politics just because its fucking shite !!!
My sentiments too--I don't buy their stuff so a would be meaningless for me. Now if did the same thing, ...
I STAND FOR AMERICA. NIKE KNEELS FOR RACISTS. Real men dont use color as a meal ticket!
Just bought stock because I believe in what they believe.
Say what you want about the police. I dont care because there are SOME corrupt officers out there. But you are collaterally kneeling for the men and women that died in uniform for you. What about there respect? Thats who you mainly say the anthem for.
they should have been boycotted decades ago for the child labor they use to make their overpriced crap... the prices are so high due to the millions they spend on advertising and you suckers keep buying it.. Wal Mart quality Nike prices
Al Bundy and Colin Kaepernick now have 2 things in common same football talent and shoe sales
Okay so if anybody boycotting Nike wears a size 8 in mens shoes, M in shirts or S in shorts/pants then hmu, Ill make sure your absolutely disgusting shoes/clothes are disposed of properly...(in my closet)
USAF Vet MST/PTSD Survivor. I get why a man in pain fighting injustice would kneel in disrespect. CKs narcissism beat humanity. The National Anthem is as sacred as attending a Vets funeral. Fight individual oppressors. Nike is capitalizing on group hate
With all of the racists burning their Nikes because of Colin Kaepernick, I propose we make him the new face of voter registration cards.
I will now go out of my way to purchase only Nike and Nike affiliated gear from now on. PS if youre gonna burn a Nike shoe anywhere from 9.5-10.5 let me know. Ill find a good use for them
Im gonna guess that the MAGA crowd arent big fitness gear customers and the folks over at Nike know this.
for those who no longer want their Nike sneakers or slides, Im a size 4 just saying.
Forward to Black power, Just do it
Let em know! RT : Stop using the troops as an excuse to burn your Nike shit. Im not your scapegoat. Im gonna sit over here and continue to buy my Nike stuff, they give military a discount
Im assuming that by wearing running gear on Sunday for the Ill be burnt in a wicker man on the seafront or at best have piss thrown at me- or maybe us Brits wont overreact
There was this one place called Nazi Germany where u had to support the flag despite horrible shit going on
If you dont want to support Nike anymore, fine. But maybe instead of cutting apart perfectly good clothes to get the logo off couldnt you just donate that clothing to someone who needs it and buy yourself some adidas?
Nike Loses $3.75 Billion in Market Cap After Colin Kaepernick Named Face of 'Just Do It'
adidas should come out with an ad and support flag and not deviding America like Nike.
Nike, Colin gave money to an organization that supports a cop killer!
I guess choosing an anti-American, cop hating, mother insulting, anthem disrespecting, untalented back bencher was a bad business decision, eh Nike?
I had a great workout this morning! I love how this campaign speaks to determination and perseverance Im focused on my fitness goals. Oh, my shoes were super comfortable . Thanks
Just waiting for the 1st school to come out and ban all Nike gear
People burning their clothes is utterly ridiculous

i need a couple size 15s if anyones throwing them out Ill take a couple pairs off your hands. Not to burn, just to wear you know? Like a normal person. As i wear my Kap jersey. And donate to the marines since my grandfather was a wounded soldier
Nikes new Kapernick ad is a disgrace...reminder to self: no need to support Nike anymore
Nike is the world standing up against racist injustice thats not disrespectful thats brave ! is dumb!
Do we all have too forget Nike using kids to make their products now?
If you find yourself supporting the wanting to , please instead. There are millions of less privileged people out there who will happily wear them in the US and abroad.
hired beacause of his political stance. Not because of his athleticism. He's not a working athlete. He's a political pawn.
I feel like most of the people doing the just wear Mossy Oak or Ariat anyway...

Definitely just copped stock for the discount, good lookin
Some of the media and the Russians are up to their dirty tricks again; stocks fell 2 points. Not unheard of
This whole is just hilarious & PATHETIC.
Weird, I haven't owned a pair of Nike's in YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAARS, just because I hardly wear tennis shoes - but happened to JUST buy a pair last Thursday for work. Couldn't have planned that shit better, and I actually really love them, lol.Suckaaaaaaaas!
The idiot wore a Castro shirt (known racist & murderer) it shows how much of a dumb F he is. That's like me wanting to stop the drug cartel while wearing a Pablo Escobar t shirt. Btw I don't support a
I never wear anyway cause I'm not a mindless drone only mindless drones wear
Ive been seeing a lot of patriots destroying their stuff in a misguided attempt at a Umm, if you want to get rid of your Nike apparel, why not donate it to homeless vets, or other charitable organizations? Dont waste an opportunity to do good.
Complete lack of conciousness on what "sacrificing everything" is .
Nobody objects to the cause. Its the when and the how that are objectionable! Example...We all support a march for equality. But if you march on the graves at Arlington Cemetery in order to maximize media exposure...Its just a disgraceful act.
On one hand Im concerned because burning plastic and rubber puts off harmful toxic fumes, but on the other hand Im like science is for liberal elitists.
burn those 150 shoes. Ill just sit here. With my 20 dollar Walmart knock offs and laugh. JUST
Sorry but I'm not burning my new socks 6 pk that my wife just bought me last week. I was complaining for a month that I needed new socks. She would go postal on me.
Lmao!! This is ridiculous!!! Yall burning & destroying items that you've already paid for.... Meaning: you're not hurting one bit!! They still got your $$ dummies!!!
Bought these babies a couple of weeks ago just before the game. It makes me even happier now
Notice how these losers are only burning the ugliest, cheapest Nikes. I don't see any sneakerheads burning their Jordans, just some illiterate rednecks burning their fucking feet off.
These undercover Trump supporters. You are the reason Kap took the knee. You are the reason hes in the spotlight. Thank you so much for proving his point all along
If you are participating in the because you feel that it shows how patriotic you are why not turn your efforts into aiding veterans that are HOMELESS and JOBLESS.
pays people $0.20 an hour overseas to make their shoes, meanwhile In-N-Out burger is one of the highest paying fast food places on the west coast. Just let that sink in for a second.
1. Create product.2. Sell product.3. Piss off conservatives.4. Profit.Just gotta figure out 1 and 2 and I'm all set.
I usually buy Under Armour for my daughter. I am now going to buy all Nike all the time.
Hey You. Yea I'm speaking to you Nobody cares. Burn your stuff idiots waste your money cause you in your feelings like Drake Kiki . What a bunch of losers Jokesters
's not an American company trying to change our minds, our politics, our vote.Using black nationalists as "trading tool"I'll be glad if Nike will have huge losses.They deserve it.
So let me get this straight, you're willing to immediately stop purchasing something because of your views, but claim you believe in God and want all of the time in the world to stop what He's already told you to stop. Funny.
Mine aren't that fancy! Jealous!!! Bought new today in honor of the
Say what you will about Kap as a QB. But this man will go down in history. Not only is he taking on the NFL for blackballing him, but hes also managed to have all these Trump supporters in their feelings
If you burn your Nike apparel because of their campaign, youre the real loser. You still bought the stuff so it isnt hurting them.
Trump supporters burning their Levis jeans and Nike shoes be like...
Ive been boycotting 20 years for being a garbage corporation that uses slave labor. Thats a good reason to do the just sayin.
nobody wanted to because of this but people will burn shoes because of
Hey i wear a 7.5/8 so if yall white ppl wanna just ship your nikes to me ill give you my P.0.
Im not going to boycott lol im just not going buy sweatshop shit
Trying to explain that burning your gear will in no way damage Nikes business
Why burn clothing? If you're damn patriot, give it to a homeless Vet that really could use some clothes!!
Just bought some NIKE'S! !!!!!
You guys pick some weird hills to die on. You're burning shoes you ALREADY paid for from , but not cleaning up local crime or trying to get better healthcare or education costs. Keep your focus on Eminem and MGK though lol.
Heres an ad I'm sure we will be seeing soon. LOLOL.For sale or trade, one pair, barely used size 8 football cleats. Like new condition, mostly used for kneeling, not running. Contact with best offer. Will trade for food.
Actually I care very much about child abuse,that's what it is. Gives me one more reason not to purchase products. Don't hate Kaepernick, but hate that he wore pigs on his socks. Simple. Why would anyone support those pig socks?
For the thousandth time, the Nike Swoosh is not a white supremacist symbol, and even if it were, your Twitter outrage campaign isn't going to get them to change it to something more inclusive
- NO, i will NOT buy Nike. Because I never did. A swoop on a hat, t-shirt or overpriced ugly shoe doesn't impress me. Ignorant dumb-fucks can fall for "designer name" hipness. Not me. Nike makes most of their shit in foreign sweat shops. Not too cool.
The police are petty for this. I always though most cops were good. But again I ask, why aren't the good cops stepping in here. Control your house. Bad cops are ruining your image. And so is this . It makes u look very weak, ill informed and irrational.
Let NIKE stock continue to fall. Gives me an opportunity to capitalize on this nonsense and sit back and watch my newly purchased stock soar!
This is what Nike is doing. Majority of those who purchase Nike apparel are from the African American Community
Twitters panties all up in a bunch because of this hashtag.
Not looking to get into a debate....just throwing it out there that if you are so inclined to burn anything you own made by , please consider donating your items instead.
Just Do It .....
I don't know why the hashtag was started, but I looked through pages of that, and all I could see were people in support of Nike and Kapernick. Fantastic!
Youre going to boycott Nike over Kaepernick, but not because they use child labor for pennies a day? Mmk
Who wants to buy anything hes selling?!?!? Cant believe Nike could stoop so low! Wont be purchasing anymore Nike products because they support an idiot!!
Too bad young man in Please return my $150.I will never support anti-American ideology

I must've missed all those videos of people burning their MAGA hats after Trump pissed on John McCain's legacy for two straight weeks...
If youre boycotting Nike because of Colin Kaepernick youre a racist. This aint for debate. Its a scientific proven fact.Suck on that hashtag

I just want reasonably priced hoops shoes with great cushioning, tech, and materials. I dont need to know your opinion about anything. Shut up and make me kicks.
because Kaepernick doesn't even play a sport, they're using him for publicity.

I stand with Colin Kaepernick. He lost everything just for us to wake up to see what was going on in the world.
Wow. Just got word that my 150k employee company has issued an immediate suspension of our corporate logo branded polos.
Just reading through some of the post from hashtag and BOY do we have a baZILLION idiots.

It's not the fucking theater or a cosy sitting room with lazy boysDickwad, it was a funeral for a war hero, the last place these treasonous, colluding arseholes should have been.
And as with every other time Kaepernick has earned an accolade, Donald Trump's supporters lost their damn minds.
If any of you fools boycotting have any limited edition Jordan's you just can't bear owning anymore, I'm here to help and take them off your hands. Sadly, I suspect you are more crowd.
big tip for all those people out there: when burning your shoes, just get real close up in there, and just, just, *innhhaalllee* those nice fumes, just get all up in there, breathe deep, and make sure you absolutely dont schedule any doctors visits for a year
As a veteran of the , I find this BS to be just another petty excuse for fake hysteria over fake patriotism brought on by a fake president on fake news. Take a seat and let the REAL patriots handle America.
I will now make a point to buy T-shirts Nike shoes sweats whatever I can find thats Nike... I havent bought anything Nike in years! So many people are with you Not happening in my household
Americans are so entitled and so full of it that they think they can really affect a global company like Nike! Lmfaoo! The privilege is just oozing out.

Some of yall are boycotting Nike just to be a part of something..... you will always be alone.....
No doubt in my mind that 's "algorithm" is geared to ignore conservative tweets on searches.Laughable that they say it's an "algorithm" because you couldn't separate statements like they are with a math equation. search,99% of results are against the boycott
Just bought a new pair support for Injustice!!!!
NIKE knows that the people boycotting them arent even their target market to begin with (probably get their gear 2nd hand from Ross), and that their ACTUAL intended market will make up for lost sales bc of how hard we fux with the cause
Everybody who's made at should do what they did to NWA. Buy up all the merchandise and destroy it so no one else can support them

Im not going to burn my Nike combat boots just saying
The hashtag was among the top trending topics on Twitter on Tuesday morning, with users posting images of themselves burning and ripping their Nike shoes and apparel. 
If Kaepernick became a Police Officer, because he believes in something to the extent of sacrificing everything, in order to uphold justice, Id kneel with him too if nothing changed and Id do it wearing Nikes.
I SUPPORT NIKE 100%. IM SURE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DONT ARE THE WHITE MALES. SO WHAT?? THEY ARE THE PERPS ANYWAY.

Boycotting by burning the stuff you already bought from them makes you an idiot, just stop buying more shit if you feel that strongly about them
These are the same geniuses who blew up their Yeti coolers....
Wont necessarily throw my Nike gear out, but sure wont be buying any new Nike! Will probably sell NKE. Too bad Nike cant keep politics out of sport either. I Just Wont Do It!
Black people buy more Nikes than white peoples. Yall dont see these dusty ass Nikes they burning.
white privilege is a bunch of people destroying their perfectly good shoes because a company sided with equality.
So true. Focus on the positive, not the negative.
I really need , , and other athletic-wear companies to make a statement about the . Tell these racist-ass consumers that you don't want their business either. Let them go barefoot.
I get the whole thing but burning your shoes isn't doing anything. Maybe just don't buy Nike anymore if you feel so strongly about it? Put a patch over the swoosh if you feel so ashamed to wear it?
As if these Homo Erectus level morons publically burning their Nike gear they already paid for isn't exactly what marketing wanted
Do you think has focus-group/polling data to show it's core market demo actually supports Kaepernick so much, that offending everyone else is worth it?
Is bein PAID by Then whats he sacrificing? True pledge their life/fortune & sacred honor 2 support their cause~Ks just an opportunist usin his 3rd string mediocrity 2 cause discord
just like I didn't care when Kap took a knee, I don't care about nike.. I can't remember when the last time I bought Nikes anyway, really who cares, part of me thinks Kap was just trying to be relevant again after his failures at QB
Continuing off of the previous tweet, my overall thoughts on the : Niggas get mad over dumb shit everyday, B.
now this.....is absolutely fucking hilarious
You say you love the Veterans but fail to see how many in-need Vets could have used all of the Nikes' that you nerds burned?
Anyone else find it ironic that a dude who wears a shirt with a communist on it (and supports many socialist programs) and a big company are capitalizing on racial issues in our country? Anyone? Bueller?
Bullocks! Hogwash! Youre a traitor, left wing kook! I will never buy Nike again! Nike sales are going to nosedive! Sports should be apolitical. You & spineless follower Nike represent everything negative about The US, even UK political correctness!
Someone do me a favour, if you're gonna burn your Jordans can you douse them in petrol first and then put them on before striking the match? Cheers
Of course, an Iranian Islamic Terrorist & Hamas-controlled NIKE stand with Anti-American Kaepernick!Ahmadinejad has called for the elimination of Israel, denied the Holocaust, called the USA a Great Satan& denies there are gays in Iran (they eliminate them)
To just the people who are burning their Nikes in response to the Colin ad, I have a question: Why don't y'all just sell them and earn some profit back? Wouldn't that be more beneficial?
In Search of: People who are mad that Nike is using Kapernick. Requirements: own a pair of gently used, size 12.5 Air Max 97s.

I hope these idots realize they are going to need to burn more than just the items that actually have the Nike swoosh on it
Boycotting Nike and boycotting In-n-Out is not going to affect their business one iota. They will continue to thrive w/o you. If you dont like their product, dont purchase it. Nobody cares.
This shit is actually hilarious af , people are mad af that someone uses thier fame to make an American issue more public and burn the shit they already bought as a some false sign of patriotism
There are like 5 morons who burnt their shoes. And a few thousand who think there's some kind of organized . In the culture war, we line up properly like red coats and blue coats and shoot at each other in formation across a freshly mowed lawn.
Y'all outchea burning perfectly good Nike shoes instead of giving them to someone who could use them?!?!
First it was making by cashing in on & now the next oppressed group. They are an equal opportunity opportunist. Isn't this like lawyers who are ambulance chasers? the chaser.
Shout out to Nike for supporting ! Make sure you supporters video tape yourselves burning your Nike gear so we can see who our neighbors are and what they really feel.
Not for nothing but maybe it was the trailer full of Nikes used to bait underprivileged kids into stealing that put them over the top.

There sure are a lot of people out there confusing "breaking shit I already paid for" with the term "boycotting". Don't like anymore? Cool, what you have to the underprivileged or homeless instead of burning a 4yr old pair of shoes you never wear

Ive never bought Nike but because Im am so here for pettiness I think I just might start that yall just mad that yall precious NFL took a L with this one
Last I checked, Trump supporters dont buy $200 Jordan 5s. Burning a $29.99 pair from Walmart or not buying some socks isnt gonna hurt Nike so much.
You may have lost your feet but you did it for a respectable cause. You showed those fucking libs. Thank you for supporting the troops as always.
I think it was a dumb move. Even if they think conservatives and military families/supporters were only say 10% of sales (they are more). Why would you throw away 10% of Sales or 10% of stock holders?
If they are so confident in the response, why did they wait until just after every state had done their shopping to announce this great idea?
Just bought two pairs of sneakers at Skechers.

So sorry to all the people screaming, burning items they paid money for, and boycotting a company that uses sweatshops overseas. On a lighter note, wonder what Starbucks holiday cups are going to look like this year...

The NFL has to be ecstatic (slightly curious why they did it I am sure) for the actions of Nike. The biggest PR nightmare for the NFL ever and NiKe steps in to take a substantial portion of the ongoing hit.
I'm just waiting for one of the brands I already like to make a positive political statement so I don't have to go out and buy anything new to support them.
Nothing but respect for for their support and endorsement of Kaep. If anyone wants to burn their kicks, save yourself the trouble and hit me up. Ill take a size 10
Instead of burning your gear how about you give it to the homeless veterans youre supposedly supporting. (A majority of these people wouldnt even spit on a homeless veteran if he/she was on fire)
They Just Did It
The is interesting because branded clothing is a durable product that provides ongoing service of branding. Now that the ongoing service of branding is unacceptable to some, the solution is to destroy the utility of the durable product?
Just a note that the folks that call people who are outraged about social injustice "snowflakes" are the same people who boycott shoes and whine about red coffee cups.
Just to be clear Nike how much you pay and NOT these ladies....
If youre burning your gear because of their campaign and you wear my size hmu Ill take it
Support those that support us!
Brett Kavanaugh leaves his house with....an ADIDAS bag.
Nike just did it.They jumped the shark.The stock is falling quicker than Kaepernick to his knee.It's all downhill from here.
- As opposed to the long train of abuses of the U.S. police state as I am, I am very sympathetic to what has done. But politics has already subsumed enough of our society. Now I can't escape it even when I'm buying shoes or chicken sandwiches.
i'm sorry but if you're part of the , go ahead and be a dumb ass as i continue to support nike & continue buying my nike pros
"Privilege is a terrible disease, because it is invisible to those fully afflicted with it. They will do anything not to be inconvenienced by the ugly realities of a system that they are the greatest beneficiaries of."
Of course the negative bullshit is trending. Why always concentrate on THIS. THERE ARE SO MANY MORE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT AND WHY DON'T WE TREND THE LOVE AND SUPPORT!!!!! FUCK THE DUMB SHIT. I'M SICK OF IT. I STAND WITH YOU!!
Time to punish Just Do It!
Just Blew It! You guys are idiots..

The people that are participating in are people that have 1 or 2 pairs of Nikes that they replace every 5 years. The people that support the movement are the customers that buy a new pair every month. is gonna be just fine.
Wasnt this group supporting New Balance the official shoes of white people ~ Who knew?Thank you
So I yall really concerned about this Im a Army Vet and I dont have nothing to say about any Race that would stand up for equality for ALL OF AMERICA PEOPLE and if yall so concern about US VETERANS WHY NOT HELP US GET JOBS OR THE MEDICAL THINGS WE NEED and ETC
Time to punish Just Do It!
$4BILLION loss so far...I thought we were done with this shit?Well is back just in time for GOT Season 8.
Nike is "pathetic"! I own a pair of Nikes.....put them in the garage and will use them only when I go out and have to shovel cow manure for my plants.
If your whole point is to support veterans, why not give your Nike gear to the homeless vet that was standing with a sign about five minutes from the Nike campus??
Not in this house! Bad move ! Support the ones who truly sacrifice!!
Hey Nike I just figured out your slogan after all these years. Im putting all your gear in the trash. I told my self... just do it! I will never kneel to false idols. .
Islamic dictator , who jailed and tortured women for not wearing Islamic veil, supports
In response to all the people burning apparel or throwing out Nike shoes, I say we start a movement to show our solidarity with and show that this country is still great no matter whose in office !!
I suspect that a lot of Trump supporters are barefoot anyway.
most people on this thread need to be buying some workboots, EBT cover that.? I don't know , never have or will use it.
Questions you probably have had for Colin Kaepernick. Its not fair to criticize him until you listen here to what he has to say. Helping the oppressed is what our savior has taught us.
is the dumbest dumb shit Americans have done thus far
If youre seriously considering burning or throwing away your Nike stuff, ship it to me, Ill get it to people in a homeless center in Los Angeles. My DMs are open.
I just want to say that I have been boycotting before it was cool, they don't make shoes that fit me. Therefore fuck the whole brand.
I feel like changing my whole outfit just to proudly put some nike on!
What we really need to "boycott" is any insinuation or fact of racism, discrimination, abuse or injustice and not a brand of sports shoes...
Just realized...Anyone else find it funny that a country singer tells people to support and stand for America...by buying products from a German company?
Instead of wasting your wood and lighter fluid on burning your Nike gear... just send it my way and Ill do it for you. I love burning size 12 shoes and L shirts and L shorts the best
Your house had all your Nike stuff in it, so you should probably just burn that too
Y'all put out of business burning your little socks yet?
If you don't support Nike and really don't want to own their brand, donate to Goodwill or something, it doesn't hurt the brand to destroy clothes already bought
I don't care about this Nike ad and this thing, but it just funny to me seeing the other side get mad about the boycott when they be outchea every week talking about boycott something they don't agree with.
.. i mean, shit. need more facts? black wall street. tulsa, oklahoma. 1921. we had our own e v e r y t h i n g. & in the blink of a jealous eye, 35 blocks of business & 300+ black people burned & killed.97 years later, the fire still burning against us.
Just to be clear Kolin Kaepernick is just one of many examples I could go with but I picked him because the reaction to the Nike thing is my topic. I could put Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin (and the list goes on) in place of that.
Phony, he is only interested in causing problems, he has no passion to change anything nor is he interested in being part of the solution.
No matter what WE do it's a problem... kneel, sit, stand, breath, eat, take a nap, order a coffee, not order a coffee, swim, drive, yawn, smile, fart, BBQ, or simply just exist. Alexa play "We Fly High" by Jim Jones
I must be super trendy, I've been boycotting Nike ever since they tried to sell those piece of shit shoes to me with the decimal in the wrong spot - um, a decade ago?
This is the stupidest shit ever! Like who cuts and burns stuff they already had lol! And who goes to buys stuff just to make a video of them cutting it and burning it. Grow up people! and has my full support
Is it safe to say, "America doesn't like social justice", yet?
Im just saying
for contact us:
Nike's without the checks are just new balances. Which white people were already wearing
is this really trending this is disgusting, despicable, RIDICULOUS.
Stay focused
To all those supporting the how about instead of burning your shoes, clothes, etc. you donate them to homeless veterans you pretend to care about.
If Kaepernick being the spokesperson for a sports company bothers you more than Trump taking Russia's side over America's, Flint not having clean water, or children being taken from their parents.. your opinion means nothing to me. Fake Patriots.
S√©rieusement ? On vit vraiment dans un monde raciste
You Nike haters are hilarious. Your boycotts wont even dent their profits. Im with Kap.
And as I've said, this is NOT a scam! We simply need all your good-condition, high-market value Nike items to be shipped to this warehouse in California for our plan to work. We will definitely NOT resell these to make a profit
If you guys really want to own Nike for supporting Kaepernick, please mail your items (the more expensive the better) to the following address:134 Palisade DriveWarehouse 4Modesto, CA 95354Definitely NOT reselling these-- here to own Nike! This is not a trick!
If you dont want your Nike stuff, Ill take it. If you dont want to give it to me, then donate it. No sense in ruining a $100 hoodie or $50 t-shirt because Nike made an ad, which is far from the first controversial ad theyve made.
I JUST WENT INTO THE GARAGE AND SHOT MY NIKE FOOTBALL IN THE FACE!!
LOL. Racist white people boycotting? From a business perspective, I think Nike will be just fine.
keep on doing what youre doing. My house closet wont be changing.
FAST FORWARD Idiots are burning Nike products because Nike gave this man a platform to show and try to change his situation.
Just saying...
must = Pro Police Brutality & Pro Racial Injustice because thats why Kaepernick was kneeling during the National Anthem.
For what it's worth, people are boycotting a company, whose newly minted spokesman is an athlete pointing out social injustice, that continues to employ children in what could be only described as "labor camps".
Ive got a feeling, just a little feeling, are gonna survive Cletus the Hillbilly burning his socks in rage
To all the supporters: Do you take the time to do anything to promote real positive change or just destroy things? Maybe stop to really look at that.
Still waiting for a Trump supporter to burn their shoes while they're still wearing them.
Such a strong individual, so much courage in one man. He fought through adversity with the odds against him. He never gave up. He got everyone he could off that island, thank you Nike for choosing such an amazing person. JUST DO IT
Decided to wear a whole nike outfit today then get on here and see this whole lol im confused
Could u imagine a grown ass man takin off his shoes in the middle of the day.. to cut the TOPS OFF HIS SOCKS!! Because of some fake outrage
If you wasn't telling to put military men as their campaign ads before was revealed, then you showing fake outrage and patriotism. Take your ass to the back of the bus..
All this energy. I hope it's being used to help homeless veterans.
So many people saying Nike will sink for this... you don't understand marketing or the concept of market research do you? This campaign wasn't a quick decision. The data supports the campaign, otherwise Nike wouldn't do it. Don't be silly.
Give your trainers to charity don't burn them. Most I've ever used.
Just do it? Nah more like just stupid!
If you're hell bent on not rocking Nike gear ever again, how about donating it instead of destroying it? There are plenty of people out there who could use a new pair of shoes or new clothes.
VOTE With you wallet. Nike Shares Slide on Plans to Use Colin Kaepernick in Ads - WSJ
For all the people either burning or destroying their Nike clothes and shoes to "Make a Stand", Patrick has a better idea. Instead of getting back at the lib's, how about giving back in general to the community. Hhmm...
thought I would add a moral support pun here
Colin Kaepernick is a total loser. He ruined the NFL and now the Nike brand. Its just sad.
Nike qui essaie juste de sattirer les faveurs des afro-am√©ricains ils en ont rien √† foutre des id√©aux. Le pire cest qu¬¥ils se font sucer en plus
What's also funny is how the left don't realize Nike just used C.K. as a cheap, short-term publicity stunt. To save the big bucks from endorsing a real All-Star athlete... that actually plays. used to be about winning. They just made it stand for losing.
Sorry people doing this . You're little psuedo teen angst tantrum is just funny to the rest of the world.Keep it up, keep placing those barriers against yourself. cheers.
Was seriously thinking about buying new Nike shoes cuz my old ones are wearing out but may just go with Adidas now. So sick of controversy & politics in everything.
'Just Do It': The surprising and morbid origin story of Nike's slogan
good job Nike Ill buy 2 pairs for every Republican who moves away from the USA
As a lib, I must insist you don't donate shoes and clothing to charity. Because, if you were to do so, I'd be owned and you would have really stuck it to me.
Some rich white folks can afford to burn Nikes but us....We're not burning shit we paid $100+ for. We're in the struggle financially as well as with Kap politically, foh
I love America, but this country really disappoints me sometimes. Now yall boycotting a company for supporting someone trying to make a difference. What a shame
Sporting goods giant NIKE is not often brought to amend its product decisions. But a campaign by American Muslims activists acting out of CAIR have gotten
Imagine the conundrum for these people if made AR-15s. Just donate your Nike stuff if you don't want it anymore. I'm sure a needy Veteran would appreciate them.
Politics in my clothing?? Push your agenda somewhere else Never buying again
DYK is a corporate supporter of and that advocates for abortion in 3rd world?
To the ppl in the I'm curious... were you this upset when they dropped the ball with child labor? Asking for a friend.
Honestly this boycott is probably doing a better job at showing injustice better than the ad itself.
I just bought some very nice new shirts at just so the crowd can F themselves.

please send all Nike that youll plan on burning/ not wearing to charity shops, orphanages and any place that will take used/ new shoes. Thanks and JUST DO IT
I know that many Americans are throwing out their tainted Nike sneakers and stuff -----others have decided to buy other brands since they are so furious about the leftist political pandering by NIKE -BOYCOTT NOW

I am just wondering is the Colin Kaepernick's Nike ad the Mistake of their entire brand lifetime or a risk worth taking? Curious to see how it all plays out and how competitors hit back or capitalise on the same...
What is really jacked up is that the benefit of the doubt has been used up years ago and so we cannot dispute the possibility of this being proven false! Open to see the full thread: Phil Braun on Twitter
I went to burn my Nikes, but then I realized I didn't have Nikes because they're too expensive, so I burned my 's instead. Sorry Puma. You didn't deserve this.
Same people that love the 1st and 2nd amendments dont know the other 25
just don't do it
Brett Kavanaugh leaves his house with....an ADIDAS bag.
So, let me get this straight....... When Nike used sweatshops in Asia to make their shoes that was fine. Use a football player to represent your brand and you start burning shoes?
has had a rough history with outsourcing and exploitation but they've made more moves to stop this than almost any other apparel company. They're consistently in the top 10 for sustainable companies and have stood up for social injustice for years now.
The is just as stupid as and . Just shut the hell up. You can still enjoy a product despite different views/ideas.
Bad move by Nike no matter which way u slice it. They are taking a big gamble thinking that a polarizing campaign will benefit them. Mind you the ppl who support the police, military etc are the ones that actually buy stuff.Liberals whine and then look for handout

Are you Looking for , or developer? Find us on Supreme Court Ben Sasse Durbin
If you want to burn your clothing, how about you just send them over to me?¬ø This is absolutely ridiculous
I never bought Nike anyway. I refuse to pay over a $100 for a pair of shoes Ill end up replacing in 6 months time. So the doesnt really affect me. Also what sacrifice did give up exactly? Besides a failed Pro-Football career.
Slaves are now taught Christianity is the only way no African names or religions. Said Europeans/Pilgrims become STRICTLY PURITAN (Christian). Which a lot of black people still follow STRICTLY (which is another subject) FAST FORWARD (just a lil bit)

I have been a runner my entire life. I have worn Pegasus shoes for 30+ years. 3 - 4 pairs per year. I wear Nike running shorts, Nike shirts, Nike sweats. No more.
Unfortunately, for those who are angered by Kap, they will not care in the slightest bit. It is clear that Kap has the ability to play as at least a backup or even a starter compared to some teams, but those type people wont care for obvious reasons
For all the people this picture is just for you, we can organise prints if you want one so you're burning your Nike gear posting the pics thus helping Nike and Colin go viral and get more attention THANK YOU you're so 'smart' art by Natalia
The fact that is trending just means that the boycott isn't actually working, because now Nike is the most advertised brand for an entire day.
I'm old enough to remember back when we didn't burn shoes to make a political statement. We just lit them on fire for no reason.
So Colin Kaepernick disrespects the US national anthem & Trump calls him out. Nike hate Trump so make Kaepernick a brand icon. That is low , no need to get political. No more Nike stuff for me.
Instead of wasting the money by burning your Nike gear ..... you could just Venmo me the money .... Thatll prove Nike wrong
Here we go again. Not only will the hurt Nike now, It will also hurt the NFL again. People want football w/out politics - it's an escape from politics. They just fueled it back up. Won't . I'll
Says someone who jailed and tortured women for not wearing Islamic veil Good for and Nike , youve got an Islamic dictator support
Thank goodness Colin Kapaernick didn't set the flag on fire, all the haters would have to burn their house down to make their rancid, racist point.
is hilarious. Nike's stock did drop about 3% after the ad. This is very temporary. is about to make BIG money off of this --- NOW would be a great time to purchase stock. Good job Nike, and congrats

I love how the Nike ad comes out and all of a sudden, people care about the supposed sweatshops Nike uses. Gtfo
I don't get it... I just sold my holdings of Nike..... sadThe stock was down nearly 3 percent in afternoon trading, as was trending on Twitter.
I no longer will buy anything with the Nike label until they withdraw their ridiculous campaign.
Tata...leaving for the bus stop early today so I can replace my NIKE sneakers. I would be ashamed to wear them now.
Lmao someone tell Paul it's not that serious
If all it took was throwing away a companies products to put them under then would have been out of business a long time ago.
you just lost my business. I dont want to be involved with companies that promote being disrespectful. The idiot you chose is just that DISRESPECTFUL. Out of the ENTIRE world, this trash is the best you could come up with?
what kind of business plan calls to alienate a large part of the American market ? Asking for a friend.
So if a non black (who kneels to show support against racism!) gets to be the spokesperson for NIKE, this is a bad thing?? What the hell? I thought this was 2018.
Just dont do
Just copped 4 pair of nikes for the family . Thanks . Nike outlet jumping today too
want a logo for Your or use??then check my gig and Order Now!
As someone that honorably served this country for many years, I am offended that this country kills and imprisons its citizens with no regard because of their race. Bigots pretending to be patriots.
Nike puts an unsigned activist over the many other great athletes who work their ass off to be great. What does that tell young athletes to strive for? Nike stock down, no wonder. I'll kneel for Nike. . Buy US-made products.
Frankly, I support Nikes decision to monetize the Black Lives Matter campaign with shoes made by little Vietnamese children
So happy to support this campaign. Most people have no clue what any small amount of sacrifice is.
dont gloat, the slip in stock price is just and opportunity to buy (I just did) when you the long term is a net positive. is a joke.
I don't know a single Republican who is actually watching the Kavanaugh hearing. The only people taking this mockery of the justice system seriously are the Dems. GOP's are more concerned with destroying Nike products than what is happening in DC.
He didnt sacrifice his Job..if so then there many NFL players would be jobless. Taking your employers platform (NFL) for your cause is wrong and selfish. Use your celebrity and "sacrifice" your personal time in the community. No argument that its a worthy cause!
Wow Adidas. Just wow wow I cant believe what happened you hear about this? why people need to know

. All is see are socks and nikes on clearance being burned. Show ur dedication to the cause and burn some Lebrons! Lmao these clowns
That one co-worker who uses the lunchroom as a political soapbox
If the national anthem is associated with respect for both your veterans and your country...then wouldnt it make sense to actually and actively show respect rather than preach by it via song?
I will never buy another thing with on it. If you dont have the respect to stand for your country and the men and women that fight for it every single day then I have no respect for you.
? I think not. Time to go buy some swag. Clearly the US has major issues with race relations & policing, and opponents keep trying to spin the dialogue away from that.
No way used to be my favorite shoe brand but since they're pulling this shit I say fuck Nike I'm sticking with buying Duluth Trading Company shoes.
Kind of like throwing bricks, burning cars, looting, and attacking inocesent people in your own community when things don't go your way??? Lol
I support shoes because shoes support me. I don't know where I would be without shoes. Thank you shoes. Stop Shoe Hate! Feet
Rather than destroy your Nike clothes... give them to charity or anyone less fortunate. Be angry but generous at the same time.
Been hearing all about this . Just realized I have never owned a pair of Nikes. Once again I am ahead of the curve.
corp. is the racist, trying to get black people to buy their shoes because they are a dying company. They are pushing everyones buttons and trying to make money. NIKE'S have been out since early 80's, boring badly made shoes.
.. wow. just more motivation for me to get those Love.O.x.'s .. and people are going to lose their minds!
This is just the tip of the iceberg. Shares of Nike fell nearly 3% in midday trading Tuesday. |Nike investors aren't happy about the Colin Kaepernick ad - CNN Money

Im just tired of buying $190 running shoes that fall apart after 2 months.
I hope you crash and burn . WTF were you thinking? That these low life LIB customers will buy these more now that the is having an effect?
idk i juyts bought a pair yesterday and ill buy more today support nike
So does the actually just boil down to, "BAD FOOTBALL MAN WEARS SHOES!!!" or what? I don't get it at all.
Hey you have NO IDEA what TRUE Sacrifice looks like....You dont care about a cause...You care about MONEY!!
No More products here.. Local Nike store here sure was empty when i drove by when its usually packed.
If you want to be apart of just give the product away instead of being stupid and cutting and burning it, once again you still spent your money on the product. So doing the childish things is not going to change anything.
Hes HALF black. He was raised by polish white people. Hes just doing this for attention... dont forget that
Wrong move Nike you should have stayed out of it! Colin is just an attention seeking nobody who was benched before his act began. Country over controversy? You should have chosen country thats your market.
....I'm Done with Nike I will not even use their Golfballs which was my ball...
Triggered MAGAts setting Nike gear on fire to own the libs because they hate Kaepernick. Sometimes they forget to take the Nike gear off
It makes me laugh watching Republicans set their Nike items on fire which they already purchased. They obviously are not the target market anyway seeing that their only amount of athletic activity is running their mouths.... Just an observation.
I was just hired by Nike to work in their Waste Management Department. Those of you who are boycotting Nike, please reach out to me and I will take whatever article of Nike attire you want to get rid of. You can reach me at 1-800-UST-UPID or at
Good to know that there are still big companies out there willing to potentially sacrifice profits for a just cause.

Excuse my language but you're a fucking idiot if you're burning gear! Sensitive ass bitches!

This all just retarded I don't think he's done anything to earn it but what about other people like the dude on Seattle Seahawks that plays with one hand or something Kaepernick is just taking advantage of the situation now and y'all stupid for not realize it lol
Okay yall, Im writing an article about the use of Colin Kaepernick in Nikes latest ad. If you have ANY opinions that I can use as direct quotes DM me!
moments of insanity,A strong gust of wind
stocks are down because of there own stupidity! I hope they go bankrupt!!! That boycott goes for college teams too that wear Nike cleats!!!
If you patriotic Americans truly cared about troops and veterans then vote like it. Stop supporting the people who are stripping every decent and useful thing a veteran has earned and support candidates who actually walk the talk.
You just made the biggest mistake. Find someone other than a bench warmer to be your face. No more Nike. Yall are out and Addidas is in anyway!
Imagine being broke, but burning your shoes and Nike gear because you disagreed with one of there promotions .... What a fucking child you would be!
Nike using Kapernick as spokesperson is just another way a dying brand is trying to get people to buy, so you idiots that buy because of that, are being used. Only old white guys wear Nikes, they are not great shoes, no style and past their prime. THEY ARE USING U!
JUST IN: Trump's fan base drops exponentially as supporters forget to take off their gear before burning it.
I cant wait to see the quarterly numbers from after this fiasco. This will not end well for whenever signed off on this campaign. Shareholders have the final say and the looks of the stock plummeting is just a precursor
If people are truly losing their shit over and . I wonder what would happen if took a knee in support of ?That would be interesting to watch

Question, how can Nike sales take a dip when the campaign just came out like 2 days ago? Did they give people time to buy it yet? Are these projected sales or just people making stuff up
I noticed is having a huge sale on so I bought 2 pair for me and 2 for my daughter. I used my account to get 20% back on the Macy's purchase
wont be seeing me ever wear nike stuff again . Stand up for a Muslim. You are rediculious
Proud to wear these today and every damn day. In fact I just ordered a new pair.
all this fuss bout mufukas not standing during the anthem fuck was yall at when we had this retarded ass dude was running for president
The regret I have today is the amount of $$$ in my Jordan and Nike collection. just another corporation buying favor from the angry mob of the left, as the same left overlooked the sins of decades of child labor.
Republicans are not only taking a stand on but we also wont workout as that is now a liberal activity. Our moral compass will keep us fit and in shape.
not sure whos idea this was but WOW shame on but then again what do you expect from a company using cheap Chinese labor you should dump and be like the use
Does wearing my ratty pair of nikes show support for Kaepernick? Or, does it say I don't respect him because consumer activism demands I buy a new pair?
Nike's new Just Do It campaign uses inspirational figures like Colin Kaepernick who believe in something, as if belief is a virtue irregardless of the values of said belief & the actions taken on its behalf.These images meet that standard.
Oh also, if you're one of the geniuses boycotting Nike, I'm happy to take all of your shit before you destroy it and bring it to the local homeless communities. LMK.
so feeling the pain yet? Stocks keep dropping we love our country
Politics and religion do not belong in business.
Just lost a customer, I bought my two running shoes, my cleats and a bunch of clothes from I was going to get an Apple Watch Nike+ band and new Nike Hoops Elite gym sack, but not anymore Who wants me as customer? ?
Just bought our at !
JUST DROP NIKE. THIS should be their AD.
Stop using the troops as an excuse to burn your Nike shit. Im not your scapegoat. Im gonna sit over here and continue to buy my Nike stuff, they give military and their spouses a discount
Just heard about the I'm not one to get in on these crazy things, but I've had these pair of Nike shoes for years now and I love them... Does that make me some sorta bad guy since I had these before they were "bad"?
Just saying, .
I thought hired star athletes not bitter, childish never has beens? Must be using the business model.
When I saw all this stuff I assumed it was to do with child labour or conditions in sweat shops. But no, turns out it's just a bunch of closeted racist assholes who just love (white) 'MURICA!
Our family applauds you! lost our patronage too...and we were a Nike family. This d-bag should not be given a line...it's an insult to Michael Jordan and others they endorsed who had respect for our country and law enforcement
Really?!? Ask what the long-term benefits/gains were for the Red Hen when it refused to serve Sarah Huckabee-Sanders? Hence why there is Nikes Kaepernick ad to provide a long-term gain after some near-term pain, analyst says
Im going to buy me some this Thursday. Good luck with your dumb . I hope its just as pointless as your boycott was.
Not my circus. Not my monkeys. Ive always worn .
"White Privilege" is wrong. It's about being proud and respectful of your country. As a black woman, I will .
You know what REALLY "disrespects the flag," MAGA-flavored demographic?A President who openly and candidly disrespected the likes of Gold Star families and all P.o.W.'s who served.If you're willing to side with a man who sided with Russia, YOU'RE "anti-American."
Just a thought
Why not support local businesses by shopping small, local, or even indie clothing companies instead?
Trump supporters are funny. I cant make this stuff up.
When you're burning your Nike shoes and apparel in support of the , but haven't smashed your Apple iPhone ...
Please stop using Pat Tillman to further your racist . You cannot speak for a dead man. You cannot say whether or not hed support Colin Kaepernick or not. That is all.
4 billion and the day is just getting started. Wonder what a month will bring.
Whatever your view on the Nike announcement today, promoting the donation of unused clothing to those in need is a no-brainer.
People understand something.. Nike dont give a damn about u all negative opinions. At the end of the day whether theres a black man or white man as the face of Nike, Nike is still gon be Nike, and u all go continue buying their gear I support
All these people that are about to why dont you just donate all your to the homeless Im sure the homeless dont care about a they would love a pair of shoes a hoodie or even a T-shirt
One day does not make or break a strock. It will be back up tomorrow. You will waste money buying new shoes only to realize where those state taxes are going. Supporting all those programs you probably hate.
Boycotters might just start wearing Adidas because it's German
Most Trump Supporters think buying Nike Products like eating at an expensive restaurant. They will spend a large amount of their paycheck for the privilege.
About this ... proved himself human some years ago, but I'm not breaking my clubs or burning my stand bag because of it.
Can gun manufacturers please start using as a spokesperson?
Really curious if you guys are really going to take this seriously? Better start smashing those $400 watches!
made a conscious monetary based decision to disregard the beliefs of a +/- hundred million people who believe the American flag should be respected & football is no place for politics. Make sure they under calculated and .
Not all white people. Just the assholes. I will continue to buy Nike products for myself and my family.
Nike products are no in my future. Using KAEPERNICK as your face of Nike is a lot like using a pinecone as toilet paper.
I want to challenge people to stop and think about why took a knee. Its not about disrespecting veterans. He was using his platform in a non-violent way to bring to light an issue that he felt strongly about - to me thats as American as it gets.
got what anyone would get bringing politics into the workplace. Now can get what they deserve for rejecting the beliefs (the American flag must be respected) of millions of their customers.
I still support Kaep, but I stopped buying Nike years ago. The quality of their products has dropped tremendously.
. is doing just fine. $NKE
Bigots when court lets business discriminate: SUK IT LIBTARDS businesses can do what they want snowflakes!Bigots when Nike does what they want WAAAAAAAAHHHHH We're gonna burn the products we ALREADY BOUGHT cuz Nike shouldn't be able to do what they want
Looks like Ill be heading out to buy some product today! Sad that some (prob same folks who trashed ) believe that is such an affront. Fact is, theres nothing more .
I rejoined Twitter last week, after a 6 month hiatus, and the is one of the 1st things I see. Thank you for the reminder.
So many people just dont get it. Can we get them to boycott water or air next?
I will never again support, purchase or wear products. Ever...
Its a great time for black people to celebrate NOT just by purchasing shoes and clothes... but investing in the stock as it suffers whitelash.
Excuse me! Not all the people support Nike Boycott Movement are white. I'm an immigrant from China and I support Boycott Nike Movement.
The threads on the in just 24 hours.....
If youre boycotting a company because of the person they chose to represent them... youre the problem.
You should have seen what conservatives did to their Macs when Apple used Rosa Parks in their ad
These people talking about how Nike doesn't support the troops are going to be in for one helleva surprise when they find out Nike makes combat boots lol
All items weve disposed/destroyed BEEN BUSTED lol .. should thank for motivation to get rid of ‚Äòem
I suggest using a red Sharpie to X-out the Swoosh. Then donate them to the homeless. That way, we help ppl & show how bad Nike Sucks!
Since people are doing the maybe will lower the price for the Vapormax Plus because I want some but Im not paying $190 for sneakers anymore.
These Trump supporters are not the smartest people
If you even THINK about burning your Nike gear because of this campaign, please just go ahead and unfollow me because youre not the kind of person I want to associate with. Yall are actually ridiculous
Bringing politics into the workplace CAN get you fired from ANY job. Harming the reputation and income of the business you work for WILL get you justifiably fired from ANY job. got what he deserved. so they get what they deserve
instead of encouraging folks to burn Nike products, why not donate them? Your soundman could have donated his socks to the underprivileged or a fellow veteran instead of cutting them up. Use your platform for good instead of knee-jerk reactions
is about to break key support. Sell now!Look out below! I predict further drop at the close as panic and reality sets in.What were they thinking?Class action attorneys are prolly filing shareholder suits as we type.
No! People, let's support for standing what they believe in! Down with this nonsense of
Maybe find a charity helping people in need of clothing while respecting that animals died to make the shoes you dont want anymore. Nah, lets just burn it.
's , even w furious people burning products/threatening re = brilliant to to /
Does the stupidity of Trump supporters know any bounds? Like for Yes, RT for No
What pisses me off about this is that I've been posting videos of myself burning Nike shoes for years, just as a fun hobby, and now everyone is going to think I'm a racist.
it rakes real bravery to be and their corporate stooges at think a washed up has been quarterback is a herojust from the and join the and
In the end is a just euphemism for
Nike shares just dropped3%
Instead of burning the Nike products, how about giving them to those who don't have anything or need clothes/shoes? Just an idea...
I really wish this same energy people are using against Nike they would use to end Veteran homelessness. Do something positive with all this energy.
'...but I won't go out, and buy Nike products, or anything for a struggling vet, cause I don't like vets that are struggling in this great again country. They should be able to get a job in this booming economy. baboons need to shut up, & dribble...'
Why would any business offend any of their customers? Stupid is as stupid does.
supporters are either racists, delusional, or just uneducated and theres nothing else you could be. Because never sat because of the damn flag
Just won't buy any Nike going forward.
urged after decision to use Colin Kaepernick as the face of its latest advertising campaign
On a deeper level using as the face of their 30th Anniversary for Just Do It is more than Nike using a controversial figure; its about Nike pushing back against the NFL.
You all can just give those Nike clothes and shoes to me instead of burning them.
Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Colin Kaepernick must be the three most despised Americans. Tweets emerged with the hashtag , with some including images of people destroying, defacing or burning their Nike gear via
It is beyond everything I believe in that you could use that disgusting piece of what passes for humanity to be an example for your company. I will never again buy Nike.
motto: Just Do It & boycott all Nike products now!
I don't wear but that doesn't mean I'd participate in a . I applaud them for what they are doing. I'm with yous guys 100%
Returned all my son's this morning. We are ready for soccer thank you and DISRESPECT MY FLAG AND SOLDIERS LOSE MY BUSINESS.
Im not suggesting yall cant buy , as buying any foreign made good in a capitalist society means complicity with the oppression/exploitation of poor Black and Brown people: its inescapable. Just remember that buying SB Dunks isnt a moral or political action
All you supporters are getting finessed. And Im here for it
Watch that Nike ticker (NKE). The stock price might drop because of this . This could be a great investment opportunity.
I'm confused about a man knelt to represent racial equality and against police brutality, he became the face of a brand and people are burning their stuff because of it? Are you just racist or did I miss something?
Jesus Christ! What part of THEY DON'T KNEEL TO DISRESPECT THE FLAG OR THE TROOPS do you lemming fuckwits not understand?
the same ppl crying and bitching about are the same ppl that went to In n Out 10 times last week. lol...
So since yah are getting rid of yah Nike shit. Anyone got any Dead Stock Kicks in a Size 7 or Any Apparel with the Tags. Cause Ill gladly buy em off you. Let me get you your money back!
These million dollar athletes talk of social injustice, line their pockets of money from companies that promote unfair labor practices and exploit child labor in other areas of the world.
Fuck me, mostly because I am not a fan of them anyway. Addidas works fine for me
Thankfully, the Internet exists for me laugh at things that happen in other countries and sometimes to think "It's good that I live in Portugal".What do people in USA eat, drink or take to be so ridiculously melodramatic?
Whats crazy is a lot of Veterans are supporting Kaep... So we know what the is really about lmaooo
at this point I'd just let them rock out, this problem will take care of itself
Smart huh.. then why would a leading Wall St marketing exc say.. "this is likely to be single most disastrous marketing decision in the history of sports that will end up costing Nike billions in sales." in fact it's already cost them $4.5 billion overnight"
I challenge one person disagreeing with the to list one thing, just one thing that Kap did to improve relations with law enforcement while his *ss was off the field. Its real easy to kneel in front of cameras. Just sayin.
I see you mfs big mad because Kap the new face of Nike I respect that man. He supported us dammit!
Americans using pics of Veterens to emphasise their point re Kaepernick.These same Americans allow over 35k Vets to be homeless...God bless America
Haven't bought anything in a while, but just made a note to shop there for much-needed running shoes
Ok so some of us do have that heres your sign you cant fix stupid sign. Just look At the hole that the Nike sign once was on there clothes
(1) Half of you: Im upset about that sneaker companys advertising so I will express my anger by not only refusing to purchase their product, but also burning or throwing out hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of sneakers and t-shirts.
To people destroying their Nike gear, you all known you'll just be buying more of their stuff in a couple of weeks. Nike knows that too.
So there is a but it may backfire because people will be purposely buying Nike products to support them. Think about all the multi-millionaire athletes that will be loading up on Nike sneakers.
- No I am not going to boycott Nike, because they are fucking retarded, just like I am not Boycotting In N Out either, why because I am not a bandwagon jumper, and boycotts are fucking stupid childish and immature!
reppin that shiz hard! A match made in.... somewhere gross. giving back to the community here.
Tell that to the other thousands of people that are tweeting the same thing as is trending on Twitter with over 120k tweets
There are far better sneakers, and by far better companies where we can put our money into than this disgusting one! We Dont need you !
Got my Reeboks on. Nike lost my business glad I didnt buy my new shoes this Labor Day weekend. Put on my Reeboks today.
For some reason the Nike burnings are reminding of those people who used to burn books.
How about one of you billionaires buy ten thousand pairs of Nikes and give them away to kids in the nearest black neighborhood.
The is just the latest tantrum to be thrown by a buncha malignant mothafuckas hell bent on spreading the disease of racism. If you wanna call a boycott against someone whos disrespected our flag and veterans, like the late great John McCain, Boycott this president!
-- I will be buying Under Armour this year. Nike made a bad business decision. This is a big slap on our Veterans and soldiers serving.
I will NEVER buy another product. Ever.A company that supports those spoiled thug millionaires who disrespect our Flag and our National Anthem doesn't deserve my business!
Could you imagine if black people bonded together to boycott white businesses, like many white people are doing to Nike? It would mess their money up, and the market. We would all be united under one nation after that though...
makes me smile, because it only confirms what i knew about certain folks in this country all along lol
The fact that there is a section of American society that is more worried about the national anthem than racial inequality and police brutality is just absurd
The people burning their Nike products for the are the same people disrespecting veterans/military who are asking them to donate it.. doesnt take a genius to figure out why yall are really mad at Nike..
Needed an excuse to buy another pair of air maxs, will do
Interesting , its amazing how people want to segregate themselves instead of trying to understand and accept each others differences.
burn your Nike sneakers, you're either with us or you hate 'MURICA...
Im going to buy a pair of to support . With the added effect of watching "Conservatives" and Trumpers
No one will remember for doing anything substantial. He should just work on his vocal cords and maybe he'll be able to move us.
saw this on Amazon: Echo Plus with built-in Hub ‚Äì White + Phili... by Amazon for $149.99 via
Omg a brand supports an athlete I have differing opinions with. Let me burn all my expensive athletic wear. The bigger your opinions, the smaller your worldview.
Some of us don't have to because we're smarter than most of you idiots walking around paying ridiculous prices to promote their crap products made by children.
Frankly couldnt care less who endorses a product. If its good Im using it.
Just do it! "Believe in something. Even when you are wrong"
If you really want to participate in the , don't forgot to do away the entire NFL (that includes your home team), most association football (the one that uses feet), all the other major American sports (even golf), and basically the entire state of Oregon.
thank you for finally burning ur pair of white nike shoxx dave. it was honestly an eyesore to the community
If you're burning your shit rather than donating it to the homeless veterans you claim to support, you just might be part of the problem
Are these same folks going to the universities & colleges that brand the gear for their respective collegiate sport teams?! I dare you!!!
This whole just further proves what we already know nd that is that White America just hates anything pertaining to Black America or any other minority!!! Please spare me this false patriotism yall are proclaiming.
Nike's stock was $65.05 on March 5. Got as high as $82.95 on Aug 3. Opened this morning at at $79.06, and has recovered to $80.01. Meaning Nike's market capitalisation is currently $128.1bn. Oh how that must burn!
With regard to this why would use as a part of their ad campaign, anyway? During his kneeling during anthem season, the 49ers were 2 wins-14 losses. He's a punk, a bad American and a bad player. Nike stock is down, and NFL contract at risk.
I look forward to stories about the homes of Trump supporters catching on fire as the . That'll really own the libs. That and having to go buy new shoes.
and diversity mean squat!They don't matter. Only Trust me: it's always personal. Just be a person.
I know I am only 1 unimportant person but if you add up the purchases i would have made for the next 50-60 years of my life including my kids its alot of $$.(socks, cloths, hats, posters, watches) Nike just lost that revenue with this decision.
3. You are not going to use that patriotism bullshit while referring to vets and acting like Black and Brown vets don't exist and don't face racism every fucking day God sends. You're not going to act like the president did not insult a Brown Gold Star family.
The brutality that black people in America must contend with when dealing with some police officers, is why and others . So if you believe it's okay 4 to be treated this way, then , join the - My for today
This new slogan makes me feel like is about 6 months from supporting radical islam and jihadists.
Simply genius marketing. Bravo
For those who are supporting the movement and using Pat Tillman as a Red Herring.
It only took me three tweets to run into a racist burning their Nike shoes instead of actually gifting them to a homeless shelter. Funny how every time I see a racist online they always proudly support Trump..
Youre probably on the wrong side of things when this guy supports your view... Better worry about an Iranian civil war buddy!
Nike lost another customer!
is global. People worldwide LOVE Nike. People worldwide back Colin Kaepernick. People worldwide HATE Trump and his supporters. So ya'll tell me how this is gonna go.
This would be more appropriate Nike!!!!! You libs just miss the boat dont ya!!!! Sheesh - how about you leftwing nut cases try a culture of RESPECT for a change!!! How about saluting and honoring someone worth and deserving of the effort!!!
Good luck living your life only using products by companies who support everything you support and is against everything you're against.
Hey Trump Supporters, White Nationalist and Republican Conservatives do not vote this Mid-Term. You, Senator or Congressperson has Nike Products in their homes. Their family owns Nike Products. Boycott your Republican Senators and Congressmen
Over 90 percent of the inmates at LBJ were black at that time. And this collective of war dodgers and "ain't no Vietnamese ever call me nigger"-types is where the first instances of dap were cited.Why? Well, because dap means "Dignity and Pride," of course.3
After MLK was assassinated in '68, and America was, once again, burning due to racial discord, many black soldiers in Vietnam grew disillusioned with the prospect of war and were sent to a stockade, established in Vietnam, called Long Binh Jail, or LBJ for short.
If Kaepernick's stand against racial injustice offends you more than racial injustice itself you might want to check your privilege.
Conservatives really out here burning their shit? Uhhhhh, yall already have them your money you obtuse granola bar
Im not going to burn my Nike gear, but I sure as hell wont buy any more. Ever. Flipping the bird to 50% of your customers isnt a winning solution. $4Bn in Mkt Cap lost in a day, not bad!!
The doesn't mean you have to destroy your shit to participate, that's fuckin' stupid. Just stop buying their products, that is the literal definition of a boycott.
So White Nationalists are burning their Nike Products and trending because signed someone who didnt stand for the Anthem. Yaar Apne Nationalists toh fir bhi better hain
Very torn with this whole thing since I don't like standing for police brutality or sweatshop labor-made, leather shoes That bring said burning or destroying expensive shoes instead of donating them is a disgusting and very American thing to do
Nah we just went to another brand. Oh and guess what Nike Stock is down - shocker - NOT.
My son is ready for first day of school. and so is he. No in this house.
fuck all u supporters dont need yall type supporting ANYWAYS .. PLUS ALREADY got yall money lmaoo so jst shut up already ! OBVIOUSLY this ws WELL thought out and they were prepared for the outcome!
So while yall are burning and cutting up your gear how about you donate to those homeless soldiers yall swear yall care about. Just a thought
I just spilled a little In-N-Out spread on my Nikes.
I always thought 's sneaks ugly anyway. They trade in misery to avoid doing business with these guys.
2. You're not going to use that patriotism bullshit while following a president who makes his economic policy based on potential benefits to himself instead of you. Because you're getting fucked. You probably really need those sneakers.
Anyone having a pop at someone for standing up for what he believes in,seriously needs to give there a head a full on wobble.
Is exactly what is happening here and with the This upper-middle-class failure is only doing this because he couldn't do his day job and got shitcanned for it
... This wouldve been avoided if you just.... acknowledged Kaep is a good athlete. And kneeling had ZERO to do with the Troops. This is merely making the brand hotter. Congratulations!
I legit need new socks. Never was a person, but their socks prob last longer than the cheap ones I get at Target, so now seems like a good time to buy some & try 'em out! Y'all are being ridiculous with this . I reiterate from yesterday:
since Nike has decided to "Take a knee" and support Kaepernick, Army and Air Force Exchanges (AAFES) should pull all Nike items from their store. If Nike supports his view, should the military community support Nike?
I dont think people understand what a boycott is. Like i dont see anyone not buying Nike, yall are just destroying your own property lmao
Heres a wild thought: Instead of destroying your Nike clothes, how about you just, you know, donate them to those (hey, maybe even to the vets who are being disrespected by anyone who kneels, but arent being taken care of by this country properly) in need.
Shoutout to for helping expose peoples true thoughts that were otherwise hidden. & also taking that risk in supporting . Thats whats up.
Its funny cause people are cutting up their Nike stuff after they already brought it and game them their money.
Im still going to buy Nike, I just bought the most comfortable pair of Nike shoes(Pegasus 35s) Ive ever owned and I dont regret it. Yes Kaepernick is a useless turd but Im not going to stop using something I truly like...
Anyone who wears something like this (cops are pig socks) and any company who supports someone who wears something like this -WILL NOT get my business!
Anyone with size 13 Nike's they want to burn, just donate to me pls.
: Strategist will be on the Show this morning to discuss naming as the face of their new campaign and the subsequent . Tune in at 11:34 to hear the PR discussion!
1. You guys are not going to use that patriotism bullshit while waving a treasonous flag, practicing voter suppression and telling us to ignore the Russian investigation.
an observation.Nike spelled backwards is 'ekin' which they will soon be as in ekin out profits from a struggling business. Just sayin'. In a couple of days buy Nike stock. It'll go up again. People forget stuff. Just ask Trump.
You May Promote Your Clinic Business To Use This Cover Templates.
Colin Kaepernick, a quarterback who kneeled during the national anthem, tweeted that hes in Nikes Just Do It ad campaign. via I will surely stay away from Nike merchandise. Whether you participate in is your call.
NIKE Stock ... Just Sell it
It's just a advertisement to go kop some nikes that's about it lmaoooooooo
Just because youve only ever seen white swans, doesnt mean black swans dont exist. Just because YOU have never experienced any type of racism or injustice, doesnt mean it doesnt exist.
Heres an idea for all you lovers, instead of exploiting Pat Tillmans tragic death for your agenda, why not donate to his foundation? You know, the one that the supports?
I'm gonna continue to buy and wear my gear, today, tomorrow and forever. No from me. Support NIKE. Support and stand with .
Yall in the are so fuckin stupid LMFAOOO you really just got a hashtag with their name trending on Twitter theyre gonna make hella coin off this. Never cared much for brands but I def think I might get some Nikes soon
I always refuse to do business with people or corps who don't put first. Nike's latest washed-up ex-NFL player spokesperson can't even be bothered to VOTE. Some example.
Im no longer going to purchase due to their decision to use as face of product in my opinion he is whats wrong with this country and divisive he has sacrificed nothing maybe they should look at a man such as that is true sacrifice
Bitches really boycotting because of ?? God, people are fuckin remedial
Yes ma'am. Lost several jobs because of it...
I find that the most effective boycotts are those that you participate in that aren't silly displays for attention. If you want to boycott a brand, for example, just stop buying it. Burning stuff you already bought is burning your own money. It's dopey.
Is it just me who thinks looks like Adam Sandler got cast in a movie about Art Garfunkel?
Racists are all about the and Im just here like
So forget what this is REALLY about huh?........ People are sick. I'm going to buy some nikes ASAP Gotta wonder about anybody who's supporting this foolery.
America, do you really think this will actually have a lasting impact? Let's be real, the ppl who tend to spend the most money on sneakers and apparel support actions.
Bro just cause you own a Jeep Wrangler dont make you patriot.
"My fellow Americans, I would like to talk to you about some real issues facing our country instead of these distraction politics and low-hanging fruit dog whistle click-bait you fall for over and over aga.... SQUIRREL!"
Its not social justice to lecture about the greed of big corporations then profit from them at the same time.
Looks like you got reverse vitiligo your slowly turning black look at your feet make sure the cops don't think your half black you might just get shot
Everyone is setting fire to their Nike shoes. I am way to cheap to set fire to a good, useable pair of kicks.But I will be looking elsewhere for my next pair.Bye Felicia.
Now they will use a picture of someones flaming Nike's in there next commercial.
Nothing makes me happier than watching indignant white pukes burn overpriced piece of shit shoes that they bought as a status symbol because they were appropriating African American culture.
Awe he burnt his gear, omg how terrible!? Not. Who gives a f. Seriously. I wonder what the world would think of me if i burned my work uniform or lit up my social security card?!
Just no pleasing some people! We happen to think is a company that maybe should be appreciated for having the guts to stand up and be counted. Lets see if this a big aux pas
Whats the point of burning your Nike gear you own?Youve already spent your money! Just dont buy anymore of you feel that strongly lol. Youre wasting your own money. And please dont say its about advertisement. You never thought about wearing Nike for just that
The real reason that people should is because makes better quality products.
And on this day we have a bunch of racist old white guys burning the New Balance sneakers their wives bought them because they think they're Nike
OK i'm very confused...what did Nike do and why are people on my timeline burning their products and destroying stuff they brought??
Just in case you didn't know where he got the idea to take a knee from.
Please update your thesaurus. Patriot and Racist are now synonyms, thank you.
burn your clothes all you want. Now you have to buy more, Nike already has your money, you're helping push a trend which encourages the left to support Nike.
Nike's New Colin Kaepernick Campaign causes problems:
Lol sounds like the same group that was mad a and . controversy sells. Your favorite pro and college teams will still be cover head to toe in Nike products...dont get mad get understanding
Im hoping that the drops the stock price far so I can buy more shares, since Nike is a great company that I am happy to support and own.
look at this picture of me saluting a fallen brother in arms. By rewarding for kneeling you might as well be the taliban. You have shot us all in the chest. Waiting for to speak up!
Rosa Parks shouldn't have disrespected that Greyhound Bus. What a bitch.
I doubt Nike cares, their sweatshops aren't based in the US, dummies.
Druck auf Nike steigt nach umstrittener Werbung mit US Sportler - Aktie derzeit im Minus mit mehr als 2,6 % bei 80 $ - Kunden verbrennen ihre Nike Kleidung
you burn socks that you already purchased? the reason the Montgomery bus boycott worked is because they DIDN'T ride the bus, not ride the bus for a few blocks then walked.....
Anyone who wears something like this and any company who supports someone who wears something like this -WILL NOT get my business!
I have designed my new logo how it looks like?Are you looking for a , ? contact me on Kyl, Rahm Emanuel, Jimin, Nazis, Russia, Grassley, Supreme, Court, Democrats
So is the new face of using kids in sweatshops and 's appreciation of law enforcement?Those who supported the 2015 boycott, who are now bashing the 2018 are transparent and pathetic.
thank you Nike don't cower to the losers. No body that supports Trump regularly buys sports wear any way. Mb if u made couches ud have to worry.
Dress it up how you want supporting = I admit I am racist... Equality means nothing to me.Thanks for clarifying!!!
PROUD TO MUSLIM
Sorry, I just can't support your company while you support Kaepernick.
"Here . I fixed it for you. Pat Tillman knew sacrifice. Pat Tillman played in the NFL and left after the 9/11 attacks to become a US Army Ranger. He gave his life in service to our nation."
If any of yall folk are planning on burning your Nike Vapormax can you just give them to me instead
Supporters of the are the same folk that cry about ‚Äòsnowflakes and how sensitive everyone is...yet are out in their gardens burning Nike merchandise because a man didnt stand for a song. Wild
On appr√©cie beaucoup ce que vous faites Nike, sur ce coup bravo. Gardez vos positions, vous avez raison.
How to do the properly:-Remove or deface Nike logo-Put up on craigslist for cheap, or donate (removes demand -do not burn - takes supply away from market, thus increasing demand)
I wonder if Nike consulted with or gave the NFL advance warning of their decision honor a man who so damages their brand.For some reason, I suspect they sprung it on them. Not a lot of happy faces in NFL marketing department, today.
never used to show the anthem b4 games- only the Superbowl. ESPN going back to not showing. Trump now wants to force them to show. This is all a scheme to whip up idiots into a frenzy.
>Defending a clothing company that known for using sweatshops to create their products all because Trump Supporters say something mean about Colin Kaepernick(Yeah because defending a big corporation that use child slaves is so woke now)
The is a good idea.Nike is shit.Always has been.Oh, you're doing it because they're being virtue signalling cuntbags, and not because they sell $5 shoes made by child laborers for $200?That's... a reason I guess?
You really don't know what your customers want or who they are. Here's a hint
Bo Jackson knew Baseball & knew football ,JUST Do IT Colin Kaepernick grew a Race Wall & screwed football. Just it Nike not made in North America
Is Nike just for the 12.6% of America that is black? What about a role model for rural America that is more brown and white? Why divide rather than unite us?
We just bought gym shoes for back to school.
I havent bought nor do I plan too ever, but I almost thought about supporting them for getting behind Kap
Since this stupid is going on, I just here to let know that I love them, including , , , , & .
Trump supporters are gonna be running out of things to boycott lol
proves yet again that Americans have "trending anger". I would bet any amount of money that in less than a month, most people fired up about the Nike Boycott (either side) will forget about it because something else is trending.
Nike has to be enjoying thishashtag> (Top 10 trending in US)THIS IS BRILLIANT MARKETINGYou get the intial pop from your new Just Do It launch, AND THEN you get additional press from a toothless backlash on social media.This was perfectly executed.
But no one called for a when they were accused of using kids in sweat shops!? However, now that they, have hired consumers are supposed to boycott!? So let me be clear. The flag is more important than people!?
I plan on donating my nike clothing to the homeless as I refuse to wear it anymore. At least it will go to a good cause instead of being in the trash or my closet
Trump supporters are literally self destructing
I wish I didn't already exclusively wear , so I could start and help balance the universe from all the nonsense.
will I buy another Nike product. You were able to make a fortune in the US, but do not support the country. Move elsewhere in the world.
Somewhere out there: a SJW, caught up in 's latest marketing ploy, trying to take a stand against the ers-... just accidentally bought a pair of Nike Air Zoom Vick IIIs
In the spirit of equality and inclusion, the will officially change its name to .
Keep politics out of sportsSport brings people together, politics divide.
Im anxiously awaiting s release of their line of pig socks, so that Ill know who not to stand by.
As a 25-year retired military veteran, THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE FLAG. I am not offended and the hundreds of active duty military and retirees I still work with ARE NOT either. So QUIT using the military to advance the obvious white supremacy views of this WH.
"I s/b the face of the just do it campaign. I'm doing it. I'm ignoring everything and going back to sleep." oh my child lol
Instead of telling the internet how vets & the US forces should be respected, why don't y'all get the fuck up off your ass and buy all the homeless vets homes and feed them? Do you think they get Respect??
All this passion for burning and Im sitting over here like 22 vets kill themselves a day because they dont have access to proper care still
Don't know the full story, but I'm pretty sure there are homeless kids, orphans, and vets that could use those clothes and shoes! But no, let's burn them!
yup.. Just today shares are down 2.68% 3 hours before the closing bell..off by $2.18 a share so far. This will continue in a downward direction.
Lmao conservatives were giving us crazy liberals such a hard time for boycotting , now they all want to burn their ... nothing like a Pu$$y grabbing Christian Hypocrite!!
Burning clothes and destroying shoes makes no sense to me if you don't like the message don't wear the shoes and clothes ..how bout giving those shoes you probably paid too much for anyway to those who could use them
wont last that long, yall know white folks wont let us have shit. Yall cant make Sketchers pop. Keep buying and burning though.
This is hilarious and this Kaepernick fellow is 6 years younger than me.
Nike supports Some dumbass burn their shoes. Hugo Boss dressed the Nazi during the WW2. Everyone is okay with this... US at its finest...

I think the is funny. All these people destroying their Nike stuff, because:1) They don't understand even bad press is good press.2) They're going to look completely ridiculous with rips/holes in everything.
I believe my good People over in Flint, Michigan STILL don't have clean water but the people supporting the worried bout my guy paycheck

Big mistake choosing this a-hole for your new ad campaign, . Some morons never learn. You just lost a customer. Will be donating my Nike athletic wear, sneakers, & caps.
Its funny, you advertise an idiot who blatantly disrespects America and all the people who fought for it, yet, when Tim Tebow kneeled to pray, and everyone mocked him, you didn't put him in your ad. Go to Saudi Arabia, and stop mocking the US!
Hell Nah - Support HELL YEA!!!! Never been more proud to rock my Nike!!!
Co worker just told me I though  whats his name went away I go its , and he good, we got him
Hey guys, I could do with new pair of flyknits for the gym if you could just bungem over? Ah dear. Most of the time I just feel fury reading about supporters. Today I actually feel sorry for you. What on earth must it be like to live such pathetic lives.

The world still has its panties in a bunch over Collin. Which is no shocker, but on a serious note get the fuck over it. I know none of you MFs even enjoyed standing for the pledge of allegiance when you were in school.
To all of the people for the who are burning their shoes and clothes: You've already bought them and supported the company, you idiot. Also you are nobody- no one gives a shit that you destroyed your clothing. And now you don't have shoes. So fuckin stupid
Bread and circus. A distraction. Do you really think a giant corporation like Nike didnt know using such a controversial figure would cause such an outrage? Of course they did. Who runs the US? The corporations.
Republicans will be homeless and naked with all these boycotts. They cant shop, eat, watch sports, etc... unless Trump lets them. They are literally burning their own shit because of Trumps culture war. Soon theyll boycott their own houses! Silly people!

Dear Trump supporters, YOU ARE NOT NIKE'S KEY DEMOGRAPHIC. They don't care if you burn stuff YOU paid for. Now if you start pouring out your beer, throwing away your guns, or giving away your Harley Davidson, you might ruffle some feathers. But it wont be Nike's.
Send us questions for our Q&A segment on tomorrows show!
Nike donates millions of $ to the GOP. So if you can't make it to your local Nike store, you can just make your check directly out to Trump and drop it by one of his hotels or golf courses.
All these people burning their Nike stuff.... smh.... why dont yall just give it to the homeless, veterans, or someone else that needs it!
I mean these folks who are burning and cutting up Nike merch theyve already bought are Trump Supporters so that alone tells you where they are intellectually

Destroying s products wont hurt them. Itll just make the real fans go even harder with our support. People try to boycott everything but racism!! This shit is sad with the masks worn daily but this shows us reality.

The only reason to is because you're a racist. Will be sad to someday realize that if you die, the world becomes a better place.
Instead of bitching about using and burning your gear, why do you give it to a homeless veteran or is that not part of your triggered narrative?
Just heard that Nike are about to launch some special edition American Flag style knee pads as part of their 30th anniversary campaign.

Unreal...I'm waiting for Kap to come out and tell us how much money he is donating to inner city youth and the kids in the sweat shops that pays kids $3.00 per hour or less.
My favorite part about this is that the brand will still be there. "Why are your socks cut there?" Like they still have to say it was bc of and honestly it's the same with police brutality. You might say it isnt or literally turn away from it, but its there.

I'd like to support Kapernick and buy some Nikes but I aiant got that kind of money. Dose it count if I buy some cheap knock offs?
I support Kaepernick and all the good he is trying to do, but I just cant get over these two pictures. Could someone explain these to me?

I have to echo something a friend posted on Facebook. If you are participating in the , why not donate your perfectly good shoes instead of destroying them? Destroying goods that others could use is irresponsible, IMHO.
As a veteran whose father died as a result of his military service, I support Nike and the narrative. I've never been a big Nike fan, but now I will buy it simply to stand (kneel) with Kaep.
Pretty sure already realise Trump supporters are so stupid that the ones that dont own Nike stuff already WILL go out and buy some just so they can burn it on twitter
PSA: Instead of destroying or throwing away products, give them to those who really could use clothes & shoes. Winter is coming & the homeless really could use shoes & clothes. What is more American than the spirit of giving?
Instead of burning your donate them to the homeless veterans you care about so dearly and just do it
are upset at disrespect to the nation when said nation has been disrespecting minorities for generations and continues to do so to this day. Catch me repping just do it campaign. Change is happening. Which side of history do you want to be on?
Swear I just read a tweet, white lady done said she not buying Nikes bcuz of KAP and that ASICS are better
Must be nice to be able to have enough disposable money to burn your shoes and destroy your coolers. I mean you could donate that stuff to people who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford it and never buy it again. Just a thought.

well America is famous for making stupid ppl richGood thing I don't own nike stuff
To people burning their Nike shoes, it does nothing to help the cause. I will no longer wear them, therefore, I have no more use for them. Instead, theyll be donated and I will no longer purchase Nike products.
Come on. Nike is no more taking a gamble than flying. You think they've done this without tremendous though, legal vetting and input from accountant? They're going to make their millions one way or another
To all of those Americans burning Nike' snickers today please remember that in your country there's millions of homeless people that will appreciate them! You don't want them fine but don't destroy give it to the ones that need!

If you're never going to buy another Nike, DONATE that money to organizations that work to prevent suicide among veterans. DONATE that money to homeless shelters that house homeless veterans.
The same people calling the immature were the same ones screaming for the
I see faces I see . Work done yesterday and more to come. Muse: fortune.
If you are not in/have been in the military or even had family serve in the military, you do not get to speak for the millions who serve. Your is irrelevant and if you dont donate to veterans or even donate your merch to a worthy cause, then fuck you
Dont burn your Nike gear, just ship it to me
The dumb racist are so obsessed they have boycott Nike trending wow I think they should take the time to go make babies because they are a dying race ! Smfh so sad
Seriously, though.
Those who want the can you just donate your Nikes to charity, instead of your meaningless, irrational, symbolic bonfires! Also, Nike already got your money before you burned your shoes. Do you think Nike gives a damn whether you wear them or burn them if you paid!
Good for . While other, let's say "less informed," people are taking part in a , I will be supporting this company more than ever! gets it! even if it means

People that do a : Why should I give money to a company that supports someone who disrespects veterans?Military veteran: I support Colin Kaepernick.Boycotters: Oh, what do you know or theyll leave no comment & block them
Please, by all means, destroy the thou$ands in Nike merchandise youve bought. Show how angry and stupid you are at the same time. Now you can add multitasking to your resume.
Yall blazing your Nikes have me . You paid for them. That doesnt hurt Nike at all. You couldve brag-donated to homeless vets or a clothing charity which would make a statement & do good & make you appear legit. Now you just look racist & privileged.
why dont you tell your followers that boycotting Nike is STUPID???? Like seriously, calm them down... they only listen to you.
Don't burn or throw away your Nikes give them to the homeless. Winter is coming and they could use them. Just don't buy them anymore.
All my black folks that make 15 an hour and up that buy Gucci, Louie, etc stop buying that over price shit and support the movement
Have you noticed the Nike Shoes people are burning are from like 1998. Theyve been in the closet unused for 20 years. They wont burn their currently worn pair

Only the White Republicans who are supported by taxpayers are burning their Nikes. They probably don't even use them. Look at them...fat cats. Go away
Didn't realize this was an either/or issue. If Nike uses child labor in countries where they can get away with it, that's even more reason to . So yeah, they need to check THEIR moral compass. So more validation to not buy the products.
If everyone boycotting actually go through with it....thats what, 6 pairs of shoes they aren't sellling? Why do people still think anyone cares about what you're not buying?! Because we don't. Find a new hobby.
Oh my god who fucking cares what Nike does, stop being dumbasses and burning your shit. Just give it away if you dont want it. Fucking give it to someone who needs it. Yall assholes are just burning good shoes.
For those of you that are participating in the , and claim to not be racist, please watch this over and over again until you get it. Because if youre not a racist, and care about human life more than a flag or a song, you should definitely get it.
I absolutely won't buy anything else Nike. No, I'm not bitter or being a pussy, I just dont involve myself with things that dont align with my beliefs. I believe Kap was a good quarterback and I believe he is a good man, just focusing his efforts in the wrong place.
These white folk and whoever else supports the are losing their minds
How stupid is ? Did these idiots forget the disrespect 45 showed a POW veteran just a week ago, also disrespecting the flag? Wow.
All I see are people burning their Nike Air Pegasus from like 2008...lol Id get rid of those too fam
I dont usually buy Nike gear but for them backing the reason kapp was kneeling I'm going to start. Some people still don't get it, has nothing to do with the flag. Go kapp and nike.

Dear Nike, you have chosen to support an agenda that seeks to destroy the fabric of our nation and therefore my self and my family shall no longer buy your products.
Not even just to veterans specifically, there are thousands of homeless and less fortunate people who would be grateful for a pair of shoes, but ya'll would rather use idiotic hatred instead of compassion to try to prove a point.
is accepting payment from a corporation that has a history of child labor in sweatshops. A corporation that to this day does not practice equality but instead uses it as an ad campaign to drive sales and is still paying dirt wages in sweatshops.
Why all the fuss now about Nike. We shouldn't have been buying Nike in the past cause they make all their crap in China and a few other Asian countries. Nike is, was and will always be a rip off.
Is the Venn Diagram of those who're calling for the & those who made fun of the last week just a single circle?
Old angry white guys are not a core demographic for Nike. HAHAHAH! Just in case you were wondering, Nike, Kaepernick, nor anyone else gives a shit that you're burning YOUR OWN NIKE STUFF! Hahahahah!!! This seriously has me in stitches
I jump on twitter and see people mad with talkin bout a so Im just gonna put this out there. DM me with all your Off White X Nike collab shoes n gear. Ill pay for shipping. Id gladly take it off your hands

You cant rank what clearly looks like murder or injustice with patriotism because you dont have empathy for a person murdered, harassed or abused in a society
Guys. The media is blowing the Collin Kaepernick story out of proportion, and they have been this entire time. Do you see Tim Tebow crying about the fact that he isn't in the NFL anymore? No. Same difference with Kap. Nobody wants him because he sucked as a QB.

I just want to say. I wear a size 11 in Jordan's for anyone looking to give them away or throw them away.
This has me rolling with laughter. First of all I don't see Rush Limbaugh squeezing his cankles into a pair of Air Jordans to begin with. And the only "Swoop" Sean Hannity has anything to do with is when he swoops by to pick up his propaganda check from the RNC.

The Kaepernick effect. The shareholders must be pleased
If the intelligence of American racists can give us hope for anything, its that the first video of someone accidentally burning their home down after their Nike fire spreads is surely only hours away
Honestly can any Trump supporters afford Nike products?
In order to show just how stupid liberals truly are, are setting their own clothes on fire.
Sometimes people forget that America was built on racism, inequality, brutality, cruelty, unfairness, and corrupt justice systems. So when someone of color steps up and do something, it looks bad instead of good. I love NIKE.
If youre boycotting Nike now, just say youre a racist, put your Skechers on and go. Nobody cares.
Apparently muslims are extreme and are overreacting for not wanting drawings of the Prophet Muhmmad Ô∑∫ but youve got Americans burning Nike clothes and shoes + sending death threats over an athlete kneeling and "disrespecting the flag".
You know that someone who served in the military can say "I think everyone should stand during the national anthem"And it still would just be an opinion
Im ready bitches, lets go! What part of democracy do you refuse to understand? This is NOT a Nike Boycott this is what Americans do when they are fed up with injustice, inequality and dirty government. Go ahead, hate me I dont give a shit!
The just goes to show that you never know who or what is supporting someone behind closed doors. The burning of Nike apparel is stupid, just like the people thats burning theirs. Nike has already profited off of the sale. The Racists Lose Again
Sooo only some white people only doing cus hell that shit dead for me even if I bought my clothes on sale
Damn, I wasnt even planning on buying new sneakers, but I guess I should JUST DO IT
Instead of burning shoes, why not give them to people (such as the homeless or disadvantaged youth) who couldnt care less about what brand they are and instead just want to keep their feet warm for the upcoming winter?

What eles will the Americans boycott? must be laughing as it'll have 0% affect on the brand. People burning old clothing and trainers. Actually, they need burning as they are busted. Digging from the bottom of the wardrobe
Dont people realize by now! When you insult our country and our way of life we dont take it to the streets like the Left does. We take our money else where. Nike better give jackets to all their employees, its gonna be a cold cold season for them

So Kaepernick is an "inspirational athlete" per ? NO HE'S NOT... & you just pissed off half of , ! So . may regret 8-year extension for uniforms & apparel.... btw, Nike's stock is FALLING!
I thought this Nike Boycott was a joke at first. We have to go out there & buy stock. I know people are really dumping it. I know a school that is no longer using Nike gear. Buy Nike stock cause it's gonna drop bad if we don't. It's not just burning Nikes joke.

I am accepting all un wanted apparel. You can trust it will be going to a good home. Im a size LG for T-Shirts, Tanks, hoodies, etc. Im an 11.5 in shoe size. I am ok if the shoe, cleat or spike is out of season. Thanks in advance
So is down following the Kaepernick add. Im sure Under Armour appreciates the business. I know theyll get mine.
Tonight, at 8:45 pm in Kansas City MISSOURI, I will set my Nike products on fire with my Elon Musk flame thrower. ,
The irony if the - sure, burn, cut up, or throw away the pairs you already own because youre pissed off...NIKE STILL HAS YOUR MONEY, THOUGH!
To the people burning their apparel, bless your hearts. Or we going to start destroying Kuerigs again just to be safe after that?!

This is why I only wear New Balance; at worst they could potentially offend rural farmers, union machinists and medical assistants as being too pretentious  at worst
I took part in the a long time ago when they started making ridiculous uniforms for colleges and stopped making comfortable shoes. Nothing new here.
What is all this fuss about ?
Nike as an organization requires steady-income to be successful. What the is doing is lowering that income. It doesn't matter if people have bought Nike products in the past. Nike's market share will drop, which means they won't make nearly as much as they used to.
Like straight up out here burning shoes, shirts, cutting logos off of socks (which they probably still gonna wear, so now it's tacky and pointless). I'm just trying to figure out how destroying shit YOU paid for is going to help YOUR boycott?

It is seriously disturbing to see how racially divided and ignorant people in todays world can be. In any event, yes, please continue to burn the clothes, shoes and other nike products that you HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED (yes, they have your money already) :)
I have the suspicion that the will be as effective as other boycotts. And if you're not buying a pair of shoes because Colin Kaepernick endorses them, you need more work on your life than some exercise will provide you.
Hey you have NO IDEA what TRUE Sacrifice looks like....You dont care about a cause...You care about MONEY!!
dropped Michael Vick for dogfighting, yet picked up despite being anti-cop & kneeling for the flag... Neither is OK, but one goes against the very people & country who keep us safe -I dropped don't watch it Now I won't be buying either

I will not participate in the as I feel businesses should not be getting boycotted. I will simply just not buy their products and let things work themselves out naturally
You just crapped on the memory of every brave serviceman and women in the history of the great nation that gave you the opportunity to turn a waffle iron into billions. Looking forward to you rotting in hell.
Why is this happening.. I just saw it trend
People are burning their Nike gear, due to the company's support of Colin Kaepernick. Good thing it wasn't Ford, Chevy, or Dodge.
Hey Outraged White Patriot,If you don't know the third verse of the National AnthemI'm not interested in your thoughts on why players are "disrespecting it" by kneeling on behalf of people of color.Your is ridiculous.
Interesting how so many who pushed the 2015 are now supporting just because Nike made Kapernick, the pusher of BLM's lies, its face of .It was never REALLY about the kids in sweatshops, was it ?A foundation built on lies WILL FALL.
just lost a customer. Is everyone that runs large companies this stupid and out of touch ?
Just ordered stuff from Nike.
Look on my face when I realize people are actually still supporting the cause by buying merchandise and just burning them . great job Nike you guys are going to make a lot of money this year so dumb

If you're calling people racist for boycotting Nike, because it's against 'a black athlete', you're the racist.You'd have no argument if Colin was white. They're not boycotting because of Colin's skin color, you colossal morons.

I also did forget to mention that I could use some blue indoor soccer shoes to match with my blue uniform that I use for my indoor matches. I could use that too. I will also definitely take blue indoor soccer shoes.
This is another demonstration of how disingenuous and hypocritical Republicans are.They say they are doing this for VETS, yet instead of giving the shoes to help homeless VETS they are burning their own property.Like literally the dumbest people alive.
Boycotting Nike in the 90s because of the working conditions Burning shoes because an athlete and activist is sponsored by Nike Fr mfs be burning hundred dollar shoes because they dont think police brutality exists? Yall wild
BREAKING NEWS: "In response to , Nike has temporarily changed its slogan to, 'Just Do It! We already got your money, as*holes!"
Ive been boycotting for 20+ years . They pay millionaires millions to target the poorest in society. It was unjust with Jordans and its still unjust.
As RW blowhards demand a , maybe US Supreme Court can make a ruling about - that's IF Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, Dick Durbin & co., don't make a total $H!T-Show of the Kavanaugh hearings! Maybe turn 's to - WHY ?
Trump hardcore base is around 30 Million people. There are another 300 Million people in the US. There are another 3 billion people in the world with access to Nike. Get your ass out of Trump ass, the entire world does not revolve around Trump and his supporters.
Broke: Boycotting Nike for using Colin Kaepernick in their advertising campaignWoke: Boycotting Nike for using child labour to create their products
Make America Sanctimonious Again! The is stupid.
Instead of boycotting Nike for the Kaepernick thing, boycott them foroh, I dont knowusing sweatshops to make their products? Child labor?
I'm so glad that took the stance that they did because if I boycotted them, I'd be naked.
Just wanted to take a moment and say...DECLASThat is all.
Damn! Nike products have suddenly become very easy to locate. Just follow the clouds of smoke!
Millennial's - GET A JOB - Just Do IT.Purchase your own NIKE uniformity clothing. I boycott nike
Really now, it seems as if everyone is making it racial.Nothing racial about disrespecting the flag or this treat country.There are many people of different colors who have served this nation, so why make it about just one color.
Air Force 1's use to be so hard. There will be no on my end. Plus I don't think Kapernick was wrong for taking a knee so where is the hate coming from??
So which one of yall boycotting Nike shoes ? Just wanna know so when I see you wearing them I can call you out!
The same people who are trashing Kaepernick are the same people who are too afraid to join
Can major lumber companies please endorse so conservatives will burn their house down.... (please)
since yall want to use veterans as a scapegoat for your agenda.
This anger at Colin Kaepernick is seriously mind boggling to me. Your is dumb.
Oh but he has. Fake and a liar. Sold out veterans, America and police and supports that.
I just seen this hashtag and I have come to the conclusion that a lot, not all , white people love everything about black people and wish they could be us but simply dont want us to be equal.
Made in the USA ! Buy New Balance and Nike
Just because people you disagree with start boycotting something, doesn't mean you should abandon your principles to start supporting the company. The enemy of my enemy is still a huge corporation that exploits child labour.
I dropped a long time ago. are better. But what has just done is an insult to every service member who actually sacrificed everything for this country
Burning my beloved Nikes but I can't stand behind a company that stands by an player that hates America, the flag and the police. You lost my business. has it now!
Also, I don't understand the whole thing..I haven't bought or used anything Nike since I was 14, the shoes are uncomfortable af and the clothes have messed up sizing. Adidas stays winning, sorry not sorry
I need Sallie Mae to support Nike and Kap somehow. So all the racist can destroy all of our files.
To everyone participating in the , I have an offer. I will purchase those clothes and shoes from you for GameStop value. All new and gently used apparel. Dont burn it, sell it to me.
This whole thing is just a load of rich, white arseholes throwing a massive tantrum over a black man being in an advert for shitty, overpriced sportswear. A lot of screaming and shouting over shit that doesnt matter.
All trump supports are a part of sex trafficking
By choosing to side with division, ignorance and hate mongering Nike has willfully chosen to be on the wrong side of history. Their next hire should be OJ Simpson...he "sacrificed" everything as well
Hey - Trump LOST the popular vote. America chose Hillary. Trump is under investigation. McConnell blocked Obamas SCOTUS appointment. Youre rushing Kavanaugh before Trump is impeached and indicted and before Republicans lose in 2018. = dumb
It seems pretty clear to me that we need to just divide our nation No longer united states
we must fight against bigotry, racism and discrimination. Burn your Nikes because you are upset that a proud American face is on it! I will clean mines because Im not upset and make him proud to fight.
This is a HERO! This man made a SACRIFICE! Learn the difference between real and oportunistic, and Kapernick was oportunistic, it just didnt work out the way he expected.......hello
Trump hardcore base is around 30 Million people. There are another 300 Million people in the US. There are another 3 billion people in the world with access to Nike. Get your ass out of Trump ass, the entire world does not revolve around Trump and his supporters.
HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO SACRIFICE FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IN MIDTERMS
Hows the stocks doing today ? I'm sure all these sheep who said we will buy double now will make up the difference your company is fucking trash and guess what? The boys that make the market go round and round don't want shit to do with your toxic business plan
Someone explain to me how burning PAID FOR Nikes will hurt their business?
Using Pat Tillman's death to counter Nike picking Kap as their pitchman is disrespectful to veterans.
Colin Kaepernick is the subject of the new ad. How many Americans are in favor of brand moves like this? Apathy may be greater than you think. On average 38% of Americans NEITHER like nor dislike it when brands use social issues in ads.
Can you get more retarded then this fucking idiot, Loves & stands by America so much the lame fuck ended up in the hospital burning the shit outta his feet. Damn these ignorant bastards keep pushing limits, What a tool
If you are happy with what Nike is doing or if you are pro consider the terrible conditions that Nike manufactures it's products under. Look at for your custom team uniforms and jackets. Support not modern day slavery.
how mercenary to use politics as a marketing ploy
Unarmed, Black and a veteran of the U.S. Air force, Anthony Hill was gunned down by police while suffering from mental breakdown linked to PTSD. Hill had been asking but couldn't get the mental health help he needed. Yet some people want a in support of veterans?
I don't particularly care about . Men don't wear Nikes. Never have. They make their shoes too narrow for the male foot. But if I had a deformed feminized foot, and had a pair of Nikes, I wouldn't burn them. Just wear them, then buy a non-pozzed shoes next time.
All of you who are into are exactly what's wrong with your country today. A shame to your flag, to your nation and to all the families. Bless for being brave enough to show exactly how vily corrupted USA has become.
Colin Kaepernick and Al Bundy are now both Shoe Salesmen who used to play Football.
Just loading up to head back from
: Will you / after who they just made as the new face of ?
Really?..... REALLY? Because you folks are so racist that you cut up your own clothing because black people asked peacefully for cops to stop murdering them.
Your little is like breaking into my house and stealing my change jar. Nike serves the entire world and more than likely makes a lot more off soccer than anything else. If you think you are protecting the flag, try again. I served 14 years. I support Kaep.
Trump hardcore base is around 30 Million people. There are another 300 Million people in the US. There are another 3 billion people in the world with access to Nike. Get your ass out of Trump ass, the entire world does not revolve around Trump and his supporters.
Just think of all the money Nike are going to make when these dipsticks move on from their silly boycott and have to buy new trainers and stuff.
Yeah, go boycott Nike because of a Colin Kaepernick ad and end up twisting your ankle trying to hoop in New Balance.
just bought 3 pairs of Nike shoes to burn im literally shaking at the fact that they would side with those libs
So how do you feel about Colin Kaepernick and the new Nike ad celebrating 30 years of Nike's "Just Do It".
FWIW I have now heard of the name John Rich. Whoever he is and whatever he does I don't care to know because I am certain he is someone whom I don't want to get to know.
Thank you for spitting in the face of the military and all us veterans who served! How dare you support a coward that won't even stand for the national anthem in the USA! Take your shoes back over seas and leave this country!
Suck my dick if you are supporting the
Listen managed to breeze through an absolute coating when they used Johnny Cash singing about heroin addiction and self harm in a sport advert. They're not going to be fussed about you cutting up your socks and setting fire to trainers you've already paid for
Trump hardcore base is around 30 Million people. There are another 300 Million people in the US. There are another 3 billion people in the world with access to Nike. Get your ass out of Trump ass, the entire world does not revolve around Trump and his supporters.
I'm not going to do anything stupid like cut up my nike stuff or even care about it, I do find it kind of ironic that a black guy is representing a company that uses slave labour to make its stuff.
Im investing in Payless and champion stock because Payless will not be able to keep their champion tennis shoes in stock
instead of burning nike gear, why not donate them to the less fortunate or homeless vets.. youd still be standing by your values while doing away with a clothing line you dont support
Nike makes its shoes in China. These incredibly overpriced shoes marketed at the African American community has literally helped caused the deaths of young African Americans. Link -
Just sitting back and reading all the racists whine and cry using the hashtag.
LOOOL people getting so triggered burning their Nike gear because is the face of Nike's new ad campaign. He kneeled during national anthem for a veryyyy specific reason...not just for show.
If there is one thing I love about a good old fashioned boycott put on by white people, it's when they burn perfectly good clothing/items that they could have easily just given away to someone who needs it. I mean, the company they are BC already got their , sooo?
I just hope the helps me get the limited shoes that I always miss out on for retail.
The 's President sides with over ALL US Intel agencies. This is treasonous. or is complicit. Those are undisputable facts.
So lemme get this straight yawl wanna have a because someone spoke out on issues but stay showing up to Mass on Sundays. Yawl need to boycott the for messing wit yawl little boys booty holes
I wont be purchasing anything Nike anymore, because Adidas makes better shoes anyways. Kap is a hero though
Im gonna just do it
Wrong, Batman. is exhibit 3, 593,257 in how racists refuse to get anything correct. isn't calculus. Racists have to go out of their way to not understand what this is about and what it is about is life and death.It is not an affront to the military.
Nike took a big risk and I so respect their decision to highlight what true commitment to a cause really means. Keep going CK!!! I will be buying more Nike.
If a cant afford shoes, he cant afford a computer to see you destroy shit to support him.
"Just Sold It"
Hey dont forget your college football gear while youre burning stuff. Alabama, Ole miss, LSU, Arkansas, Oklahoma, USC, Georgia, Texas, Florida State, and Ohio State are all Nike schools
When will people learn to use their energy for GOOD. The idea of a is completely ridiculous!
If you support youre racist as hell and I hope your dumb asses burn your kicks while youre still wearing them

I want to see someone burn their off-whites... thats boycotting. Not cutting off the logo from your socks or burning you air monarchs. Lets see if you guys are really about the ! Until then, you all look foolish because youre burning meaningless shit.
I was an Adidas adept... Hated Nike! But now, because of this stupid medieval , I support Nike from now. They show they have BALLS! Gonna change my fitness clothes and shoes into Nike.
It's super easy to be against something when you simply do not understand it. You must be patient and understanding with the ignorant
this whole thing just makes me wanna run out and buy EVERYTHING Nike.
I support . Never liked Nike nor the NFL. I bet Kaepernick will be remembered as the jerk that killed the NFL 30 yrs from now.
Niggas out here boycotting Nike cause Colin Kapernick is sponsored by them. People dumb asf. Say Goodbye. SIMPLE. Thats Tuff. (My lingo from )
Aaaaand we are back to branding white folks racists for the , for not supporting Its purposefully divisive and inflammatory that forces conflict. So kudos to for ending a week in which Americans finally stood united, with differences aside.
Yup, I'm participating. I purchased all green Jordans, the black and another pair of Nike's for everyday use. Oh, I forgot I went to the outlet and purchased all Green Air Max's.
And here I just bought myself three Nike shirts a few weeks ago. I wish I hadn't...mainly because I would like to buy them again today to show my support. Guess I'll have to go shopping.
short Nike. The market does not care about virtue signalling. And nobody outside of the USA cares who that funny looking dude is. Might be a case of the marketing people living in a bit of a lefty bubble. shorting
I like Nike's new campaign, but a simpler and more effective way for them to promote social justice would be to stop running sweatshops
First off, FUCK NIKE and their overpriced crap, and tricking ghetto kids into wasting their money on idiotic sneakers. Second, how about the NFL and Colin Winkydink clean their OWN house first. There's STILL a racist-named team called WASHINGTON REDSKINS. WHY??
I can by simply not buying their stuff but Im not going to destroy my Nike property because they decided to make an Anti-American the face of their JUST DO IT slogan.
But seriously, these people burning/tearing up their nike gear are DUMB
Maybe should refund every pair of Nike anything purchased that people have receipts for and donate it to the homeless to show how much they love the people. Just a thought.
$NKE is an anti-America anti-cop company. Strong sell. Patriots will take them down. Other corporations should take notice. Have already lost about $3 Billion. This is just starting.
The saddest part of the is not the obvious foolishness, hypocrisy, and white lunacy, but the fact niggas who burn gear/wack shoes don't use the so I'm still never winning a damn raffle...
Any American out there who just want to burn or cut their stuffs should just mail it to us in . We need those swag. .
1.5M in poverty and 23% of homeless are veterans. Your support would be better shown by giving back to actual veterans.
I have always thought Nike was over priced 4 what U get Just to pay their athletes So 4 me 2 get behind the Situation normal
Instead of cutting and burning up clothes, how about y'all just donate them to the continuous rise of HOMELESS veterans in this country that y'all pretend to care so much about!
Take a look around America today and all you see is people yelling at each other. Peak outrage culture. Take a breath people. Chill the fuck out.
? yall tripping I just bought some Nike boots and Air Max
Ordered my husband a new pair of Nikes today
Maybe instead of cutting up and burning your gear you should donate them to the homeless and homeless since yall love the meaning of the just a suggestion
I must truly be a racist if I think you should obey police commands and not fight back.
Participating in the by wearing my Nike socks, shoes and even my Nike belt today, just like every day. Sticking it to the man! That'll show everyone! You can't handle me and my boycotts!
Oh Dear God this has to be at the top of the 2018 dumbest boycotts. So yall spent yall hard earned money on expensive Nike apparel and now are destroying it because you mad. Nike still got yall money so whose the really dummy here
Way to go ! Change usually doesn't occur if you don't get a few people mad. The ad's quote speaks volumes, not only for but for Nike as well!
The is stupid. Ignorant, in fact. Stop using veterans in your argument when you aren't doing anything for them. Actions > Words. Help a veteran rather than burn Nike products which are going to sell regardless of your boycott. Nike is international. They will sell.
I'm wearing NIKE all week. and just put $3K in $NKE stock options... understand haha the WORLD stands with NIKE. Europe, Middle East China, Africa, & Latin America.

The is a massive display of tantrums from reactionary s and social injustice warriors. These little bitches should do the world a favor and off themselves in their safe spaces.

Hey you have NO IDEA what TRUE Sacrifice looks like....You dont care about a cause...You care about MONEY!!
The folks who are burning their expensive and yard sale gear...are burning it because they dont like black people. There I said it. They know how much black people love Jordans so they boycotting.
Buy shoes instead, they are assembled in America and 70% materials are made in the USA making them the most American Made Athletic Shoe in its class!
is working great. Lots of USED nike stuff being destroyed, and in response.. LOADS OF NEW NIKE stuff bought. Me for instance! I got a great PINK hat for the and some new shoes!
- Forget burning ur stuff. No more Nike....Just Do It!
Until I see some Js, Nike MAGs, or some expensive/rare shit burning, I dont respect nor recognize yalls foolery. Hell yall been boycotting obviously.
please have the sale of the lifetime on all your stuff so everyone else can enjoy it while the racist suffer and eye me jealously as I walk down the block head to toe in my new Nike track suit.
What a Tuesday, The Left does not know how to act. They are embarrassing themselves at the Kavanaugh Supreme Court hearing and Nike signing Colin Kaepernick: trends, stock slips over 'Just Do It' campaign and I'll also join the .
Let's not forget when Nike had a discount to show their support for police officers not that long ago. Nike is a corporation, their goal is to make money and capitalize of publicity period. All these dumbasses and their fake outrage
The people who are boycotting Nike for their bold move are DEPLORABLES, RACISTS, and people who are the worst of us. Nike boycotters should be DEPORTED.
Anyone participating in a is proving exactly why was kneeling in the first place: because too many white people value their songs and flags and privilege, above the lives of people of color. ...

Anyone supporting the is actually an idiot
If you follow the hashtag, everyone that isn't shadowbanned is calling supporters of the boycott racist.
wore socks portraying cops as pigs, and supports cop killers. does not have to be turned into a black vs white issue.
As a person who grew up in the miltary, I'm offended by the pictures of troops and flags being used to misrepresent an issue that doesn't exist. No one, not Nike nor Kap is talking about, or denying, the sacrifices of servicemen and women. So just stop.
doesnt really matter to me because I quit buying from them last year when I embraced .
I have never bought anything Nike in my life. And have been boycotting Nike for decades over their use of child labor to make their products.
Wearing "branded" socks is a doofus move anyway, unless they're Gold Toe. Chop away.
We really should not mind the people who are supporting the for they have abandoned and been boycotting unconditional American values much longer!Par for the course!
Congratulations you are now the face of a company who has always supported and .
people boycotting are the same morons doing the dance.
But I suppose you racists folks are used to burning shit. Ya know, like crosses in front of homes, black churches, etc.
I have family/friends who are in the military along with my dad and uncles/cousins who have retired, so I know what I'm speaking on. For those doing this just shows your true racists colors because for you to not educate yourself on the matter makes you just that!
So people are really getting rid of their Nike gear because of CK. They missed what the purpose of him kneeling!
Just threw all my Nike clothes in the fire. Take that you fuckers!
still makes shoes in the USA and they don't hire Anti-USA athletes to promote their brand...Just sayin'! is garbage and so is ! buy !
So trump supporters have another company of the week to boycott give me a break. In other news the word boycott sounds gay they should boycott that too.
People rather burn their feet and shoes to make a nonsensical point.A $60 pair of shoes is about to cost people THOUSANDS IN THE ER!From the second I saw the new Nike/Colin Kaeperknick ADI knew would be trending TODAY. BUT I MEAN WTF.... BURNING YOUR TOES?!
Nike should have included real heroes in their campaign. Why not use pictures of American Veterans instead of a football player who knows how to kneel?
Instead of destroying your and apparel like a bunch of idiots, I've included a link to where you can donate to our in need, cause you know...
How come when republicans want to boycott something they just start setting shit on fire? Wonder how theyll react when we impeach their dear leader
... Also 30 years down the line we will be talking about how great Nike was for sponsoring and helping Kap not those who burned Nike clothes. Just saying
Dear American friends. Colin is a hero. He refuses to blindly accept the mistreatment of people who look like him and is taking a stand against it. This should make you proud. He is, in many ways, the embodiment of what America should be. I support him.
I will BUY Nike now ...Just because you are burning them ~ is nonsense~ I & ...all those who are against are a joke , I didn't hear any of them speaking against when he disparaged
, instead of burning your for the , why not donate them to folks who may be wearing some busted shoes with holes in them... Something like: be smart and .
Nate has been on the frontlines of this thing. Cant say it any better, ignorant Americans think we, the Army guys, are all from the same mold.
Rocking a ALL nike fit just for yall MAGA folks out there
The people participating in the are just idiots. I just....I have no words.
is just racists throwing a tantrum

Conservative masculinity is a contradiction of terms.. Muscle your way into a cabinet position... Oh yeah, that ain't happening...
As a veteran...of the Hurricane Katrina Recovery '05; evac of Beirut in '06; and Iraq that same year: stop saying players kneeling is disrespecting. I'm not offended. Most vets aren't. So fuck your
....that'll work!!Look at the conservative boycotts of...Ben & Jerry'sStarbucksHawaiiHamiltonthose were all successful!! Ben & Jerry's and Starbucks went out of business, Hawaiian tourism went into the toilet and Hamilton closed. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This is just like when people burn their jersey's when a player leaves their team Ex: KD. One person does it so they all try and get their 15 minutes of fame because actions like this spread all over the internet.

.... I will never again any product Nike makes. You just had to go political. You make sports gear. You shouldve just stuck to that. Now you have insulted the majority of Americans in this country. I hope this bankrupts you
Y'all can boycott all you want and it's not going to faze Nike. Burning, Ripping, and shaming the shoe company's products is not hurting them because they have made billions of dollars from other countries and regions.
All of you are being played, just to different degrees.
Just got myself a new pair
If the was truly about love of country and patriotism then these idiots would be burning their maga hats because of the Russian asset in the whitehouse.
I don't even need a new pair of shoes but I think I just may go get a new pair of 's today!

I'd like to see do 1, just 1, ride-along with a big city police department: Chicago, Detroit, LA. It can even be with black patrol officers - not that it matters. I challenge him.
Of course we shouldn't participate in a that would be ridiculous but we don't have to irresponsibly portray the corporate players at as being at the forefront of a popular struggle or , ever. They have always been about selling athletic shoes & gear.
Dude just burned 5 pairs of Nike sneakers for . Thats 5 pairs of sneakers he could have donated to homeless vets. I guess tzedakah isnt high on my mans priority list.¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Conservatives destroying their property over the thing is hilarious.
Watch until the end, trust me
Since when did the leader of some campaign for ever matter. We really don't need to care about this kind of thing. Focus your attention on
Because burning shoes they already paid for really gets Nike where it hurts.

Nike Stock is crumbling. Americans are not racist, rather, Kaepernick's flag kneeling has no measureable goal, is illogical & causes more harm than good.
Sooo I cant wait to catch the news this evening. I just know someone gone be on there bc theyve burned down their house trying set some tennis shoes on fire
The campaign shows how moronic the Trump supporting Americans really are... you mugs!
Heck, a bunch of the tweets with are also throwing around the overused "racism" accusation as well.
I would rather see people who are upset donate their Nike clothes to people who need them rather than burn them because of a boycott.You've already paid for them. Every homeless person on the block should have some Nike clothes to wear.

my favorite POTUS said it best " Patriotism Means to stand by the country, It Does not mean Stand by any President or any other public Official" - Theodore Roosevelt. So tell me whats more important what trump defines as patriotism or stopping police brutality
Hey people, youre breathing the same air as Kap. You should boycott oxygen too!! Thatll really show the libs.
But, this isnt such a great thing to wake up to. Snap out of it, already, folks. Youre acting like petulant children throwing hystrionic fits because someone you may not like nor agree with has support. Get over yourselves.

When i see a pair of these getting burned then im going to know that alot of yall racist mfs serious.
Funny thing about is that those Americans who are burning their stuff are so egocentric that they think Nike only sale their products in America. Most people outside USA support what Kaepernick is doing. I wonder how much American market represent for Nike's sales...
Everyday humanity takes a step backwards i am a white man myself i respect all races and believe everything should be equal what colin did was needed people need to realize how big of a deal police brutality is i will support nike and kap
wore socks portraying cops as pigs, and supports cop killers. does not have to be about the anthem issue!
If you're mad at Nike, please donate your shoes rather than burn them. There are many homeless brothers and sisters in my community who do not care about the politics but would be remarkably grateful for the shoes. To donate your shoes, please contact me directly.
Publicly traded companies with shareholders have no business making political statements like what just did with Kapernick. As a shareholder I am pissed that management is so arrogant. They should be sued.
Just think about all the money people wasted on that. People are destroying their Nike products in response to Kaepernick ad

The is going to succeed. Because choosing a cop hater, Colin Kaepernick, who wore pigs on his socks disgusts everyone. This football player is not a role model in any way for anyone.Loyalty to an overpriced product has it limits. Nike will find out what the limit is.
Dipshits burning their stuff that they've paid for! Same when they were buying millions of Judas Priest albums and smashing them. Ripping the swoosh off your socks? YOU'RE STILL WEARING THE PRODUCT!!

Glad more people are finally seeing what I saw 20+ years ago. Paying millionaires millions to target the poorest in society was unjust then and is unjust now. Peoples reasons may be different but just dont do it.
This and In N Out thing is ridiculous. Have we gotten so low in society that we have to judge you on your political side based off of the shoes you wear and then a place you go eat a double cheeseburger?
Even suffers with TDS/TAD. The management have obviously suffered a breakdown to not have seen a drop in their stock coming with the Kaepernick as an endorsement announcement. Liberalism is a mental disorder!
Just called Nike to tell them what I think about their latest anti-American move, hiring Krapper Dick... over an hour wait. Made my day...
Um just " never do it"

When will athletes realize that all we want you to do is play the game and stop putting down the country and culture that afforded you the opportunity to become a millionaire in the first place. So done with Nike! Im coming for you!
So the people a part of the are hypocrites. How can you attemp to judge a man for standing up for what he believes in and yall are literally doing the same thing with this boycott.
Is anyone really "boycotting" Nike or are they just saying they're boycotting because they can't afford Nike??I'm thinking the latter...

Only customers will lose are the ones who wear these.
"Even if it means sacrificing everything." Wow, it looks like a lot of people are taking that last part real seriously. Personally, I'm more a FILA person.

Some of the tweets I'm seeing related to this are reminding me that you can just accuse others of having "privilege" when you don't agree with their viewpoint and cannot come up with a decent argument.
You can if you want, but burning your shoes, cutting your socks, etc. is not helping anyone's cause. If you feel the need to purge your closet, then donate those items. Cause someone would really appreciate a good pair of shoes.
People boycotted the because of Kap kneeling. I bet those are the same people doing the too. But I thought it was about the flag though??
Let's hope so because I refuse to back an organization that will use that American hating, cop hating as its face. Or should we call it a**?

Bye bye you guys messed up big time !!! But why would you care! You have billions of dollars but you just lost this ones business !!
Its not about a . Its about calling out fast fashion & capitalism for exploiting people of color everywhere. Capitalism is built on racism. We can support while holding accountable to respecting workers.
The market is concerned Nike will be held liable for serious injuries - apparently many who burned their shoes forgot to take them off first.
The fake outrage shown towards has to stop. Y'all know y'all gone keep supporting them no matter what. Y'all been fans and will continue to be fans.
Hey are you boycotting Adidas and Puma too? Along with their stock is also down 2% with Under Armour up a 1/2 percent. But please tell us more how people who buy Nike on clearance are impacting the stock.
Shoutout to all the white people participating in the . You know our ideas must be correct when it is literally only white people supporting the idea.
Nike uses child labor and exploits workers! Nearly everything sold by companies that make sportswear in the states (Addidas, Reebok, UA etc) is made in sweat shops. If you say youll boycott, youll walk around naked...
The and burning of Nike products just goes to show the mob mentality of Trumpers and white supremacists. When they don't get their way, they just burn stuff until they do.
Yep Nike Shares have taken a dip and I'm sure will keep going down as long as that Idiot continues showing his face on their adsHe looks creepy and I'm not supporting anybody who cant support our FLAG and our military. I'll donate my Nikes to the dump!! Boycott!!!

My dad was a disabled veteran. If you want to support veterans like him, support and volunteer at the VA. Understand veterans issues. Hire vets. Burning your Nike shoes will not help a single veteran.

Dear people burning your shoes that you already paid for, because of a , to be on the safe side have you ever considered burning everything you already own, that would really show those "Libtrards"
Why burn something you've already bought? Plus, people outside the USA will still buy Nike products so the boycott will be short-lived
Military personnel, their dependents and spouses can enjoy 10% off purchases. The discount applies to active, veteran, retired & reservist US Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard personnel.

Thank you for your opinion, brand new zero follower account! Your damage control for the is not at all suspect.
Imma just go out of my way to buy Nike products now...I dare someone to call me unpatriotic
I'mma keep it real. I have no arches in my feet and the only sneakers that support me is Nike. I understand the , 100%. I feel that Colin Kapernick is being made into a scapegoat.
Currently thinking of how to save up $ to exclusively buy Nike gear from here on out. Thank god their product is already amazing and thank you for doing something that matters.
The only ones screaming stand for our flag was the ones whooping us in the back. Yall dont love your country, you dont even support the vets thats alive today. So STFU
"We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation, who has leveraged the power of sport to help move the world forward" Gino FisanottiVP Nike North AmericaAre you SERIOUSLY saying he helped "move the world forward"???
The real reason to for the should be the fact they use cheap Asian labor to sell you $15 dollar shoes for $100+.
. No more Nike for me! Will save me some money too. are much more comfortable anyway. What the heck are they thinking?? Suggestion: Just DONT Do It!
Wait! So Nike using child labor didn't cause a boycott but Kaepernick does?? WOW!
People who are burning their Nike apparel over Colin Kaepernick are probably the same people who make fun rioters burning their own cities.
Suddenly the SJWs have forgotten about the sweatshops and will be sporting Nikes because a rich football player who resents growing up in a more wealthy "white privilege" lifestyle than most white people kneels for the anthem
it must get expensive being a hate-filled Redneck. y'all throw more tantrums than my 1yr old nephew.
, im not an overly "patriotic" racist murican idiot who burns clothes that they already bought supporting the brand in the first place.I'll buy more Nike now honestly, shout out to & this country has to do better, this is a good step.

Its probably never a good idea to let politics infect your business......but if your exports to the United States are at stake, then I say WHY NOT?!? What else do you have to lose??
Liberals think Vets want used smelly old shoes because they have 0 respect for them, the homeless, minority groups, black on black crime.Lets see a'Buy new shoes for Vets' lib movement.Then I'll believe these closet socialists care about vets. Look how SF cares
If youre actually burning shoes in part of the dont, just donate them dont leave a kid without shoes because of a political message
It's interesting seeing all the behind the . Like weren't y'all just defending NutJob Jones & his delusional tirades? Ugh, critical thinking courses should be required for social media, (<-- look, you can do both)
Watching ignorant racists try to do the is too funny. They are going straight for the Adidas. Adidas was founded by actual Nazis. ‚ÄòCause nothing says I love America and the troops like some German Nazi footgear.
So everyone who was just pointing a finger and laughing at the people who were boycotting In N Out are now boycotting Nike? Ya'll honkies gotta stop making yourselves look like asses.
Just do it.
ALL YOU IDIOTS BURNING YOUR NIKE SHIT!!! IM FUCKING DYING LAUGHING!!!You DO realize YOU PAID for that already, yes? You GAVE your money to Nike. No turning back. You people need to just go back to swamp and stay there. Good God!
of burning shoes, why not give them to homeless veterans. Isn't this about the veterans anyway? You are not hurting Colin's pocket, but there are 1000s that could use those shoes that you are destroying.
Kneeling is a way to promote DIVISION & Social Tension! Colin Kaepernick is a RICH & Privileged man, who makes a fool of those who live a daily
Just ordered Nike products for the whole family.
: I don't agree with the boycott the same as I don't agree with liberals boycotting In & Out.
Im confused why people are boycotting Nike now after Colin is being used to further their agenda. I started my boycott years ago when I saw how they exploited their labor force! were their 1st offense!
All the folks doin SERIOUSLY! That stuff your burning or discarding, SHELTERS take that stuff! Even if its worn! Give it to your local shelter.
So..... the same people that care so much about the veterans are going to burn their clothing/shoes/gear INSTEAD of donating their stuff to homeless veterans in need?? Stop using veterans as a facade for your ignorance and hate.

My family has supported and worn Nike great symbol for over 30 years, but the American flag symbol my family has fought and sacrificed in every American war since the founding! Sad to say I will never wear Nike again...
Usual one day threats of Ill huff and Ill puff and Ill blow your house down! Nike has gumption. Ill be looking for Nike stuff to buy. So will many others. CK will triumph. NFL will pay settlement damages.

If people boycott a company that uses slave labor over who they picked for their new mascot, it says everything that needs to be said about them...
Has anyone actually been more or less likely to buy a brand based on whos leading its marketing campaign?Perhaps Tiger with Nike Golf, but that was them expanding into an entirely new market, so can we confidently say there was a causal relationship?
Ill just go for a run instead.
Keapernick is a spoiled brat raised by white parents. He got injured playing football, took some classes at UCBerkeley and became indoctrinated with Marxists Communist propaganda. What is so special about him, he's just a Communist
This just turned into Nikes favor giving them recognition
Friendly reminder that if you dont agree with , you dont have to burn your shoes. There are plenty of people in your area who would be very appreciative of a good pair of shoes. Donate them. Just do it, pun intended.
Saw a good idea today - instead of burning your shoes, give them to a homeless Vet. Nike obviously doesn't care about Veterans with this new campaign, let's make sure they know the rest of the world does.
? It's a fucking shoe. Put it on and do what you usually do. I cant believe that people are really dumb enough to have a fight over a shoe.
is the epitome of US entitlement and arrogance
is so powerful it turns in to raging supporters of . Theyll now buy even more crap shoes made by kids in sweat shops so kids in the ghettos can kill each other over them. Oh, what a crazy backwards world create.
Hey...fun fact: Your boycotting now does nothing because you already paid for the products you're destroying. My suggestion if you don't want those Nike products anymore? Donate them. There's a lot of people who could use them.
Yes Doug, I'm sure Nike, the multi billion dollar company, is reeling over the fact that you're setting fire to those $50 tennis shoes you found at Famous Footware and subsequently paid for. Reeling.
I will continue my passive boycott of Nike, not because I support dingbat looneys, but because I cannot afford them.

Sometime tell Colin Kaepernick that when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is tweeting in your support, thats not really a good thing.. I have no Nike gear to burn, but if I did I would give it to the homeless and needy instead of burning it.
Oh, now if you attempt to type in , you can see it pop up as a suggestion. Twitter had stopped this and had instead suggested a confusing hashtag. This is what subtle censorship looks like. But users get it.
Are you here for Nike after it used Colin Kaepernick for its "Just Do It" campaign? Vote!
I just bought some Nike stock (NKE) to support their bold decision to use Mr Kaepernick as face of their campaign. Next, I'll go buy some Nike socks, (and maybe that gorgeous dress has been wearing- love the orange peel color.)

I'm no business major but even i can see that having kap as the face of your band isnt good idea. half the population of america hate the guy because he disrespects the anthem and flag! could potentially lose millions of customers.
Yo , you cool for doin this ad campaign, but I am still an wearing dude! Instead of buying your stuff Ima just give money to programs that help fight police brutality and injustice and to programs that help our Veterans! I see you though!
If yall are supporting the please dont burn the shit... donate it to a shelter or give them away. There are people who need shoes and clothes, who dont have the privilege to burn them.
Here is an idea, don't burn your shoes donate them to a homeless shelter or just clean them up and give them to someone that need shoes.
when is taking one knee evil, treasonous, anti-military, disrespectful to the flag, country and national anthem
Excellent point  is all hes looking for is and is too dumb to see it. Complete morons . As for me/my house were 100%.

The Venn diagram of angry white guys burning their Nikes and all the people who buy Nike merchandise is two circles that are like, juuuussst barely touching. And after 6 months theyll all just merge back into one big Nike-purchasing circle anyway
This shit is just straight up stupid and racist
Nike is another dumbass company that doesn't understand that you don't mix business and politics. Half of this country will disagree violently with their position and the other half will violently agree. Nothing like alienating half your market for nothing.
Do the thing if you want, but instead of burning your shoes, please record and post a video of you donating them to a homeless shelter. Because, you know, some people need basic things like shoes and couldn't care less about the politics of footwear. Thanks.
To all you leftists complaining about "racist Trump supporters" going nuts over Kap and Nike. Ask yourself this, What has Kap, or any of you, done to stop police brutality? Nothing? Sit? Kneel? Good job. You haven't done anyhting besides bitch on the internet.

Think- if people who support the flag and boycott Nike are racists why are the people who openly hate the angry white people not considered racists? Those who support Kaepernick breed division and racism.

If Cap actually knew what he was talking about then more people might take him seriously. Unfortunately he is uneducated on the subject he stands for! As are the people who support his ignorance.
Kaepernick has become an international rebel icon. He will be remembered long after the idiots are dead & burried. Can you imagine if Nike could attach their brand to Ali, Che, Freda Kahlo or Bob Marley? They just did it. Brilliant move!
Just to set the record straight here my feelings about the are the same as my feelings about ALL OF IT IS STUPID AND IF YOU WANT A DOUBLEDOUBLE EAT IT AND IF YOU WANT A NIKE SPORT BRA YOU DO YOU GIRLFRIEND.
Nike supports a guy who disrespects U.S., National Anthem and the U.S. Flag.
I just did it-joined a boycott of Nike
Didn't Nike have labour camps filled with child workers in the far east while at the same time paying star players obscene money? Where was the when it really mattered? Get over the CK thing, pay attention and recognize that there are some serious issues.
Let's be honest, the lazy bigots burning their Nikes are just trying to get out of doing cardio.
This is the opportunity Big Baller Brand has been waiting for!
ppl boycotting Nike are fukin stupid...Nike isnt losing anything by them ruining/burning merchandise. at the end of the day, Nike already have your money and you just lost a good pair of sneakers
White people just love making themselves look dumb asf lmao
Hey lefties, this is why capitalism is great. Companies will listen to you because they have to in order to make money, while governments can totally ignore you without it hurting them. Try a black and gold pill. Become libertarians!
If Colin Kaepernick actually 'sacrificed' his football career for his cause and for his beliefs; why is he suing the NFL?
to the questionable individuals taking part in the - burning trainers does not cause Nike to lose money - you have already purchased them lol
We need show these people stop pushing their Agenda down our throats
Instead of tearing down clothes over Colin Kaepernick Nike ad, how about you never use them again and give them to a homeless person who actually needs them. Win win for everyone and you actually get to use your logic for a change.
Before throwing out your new shoes, there are many homeless shelters that could use the extra inventory.

If I was going to partake in this , I'd just give my sneakers to someone that needed them.Good job on burning them. Nobody cares about what you do, you're out a pair of shoes, and you're fucking up the atmosphere more.
If refusing to worship a magik cloth offends you and endless bombs being dropped on people for the last 60 years doesn't offend you, then you have a problem.
How do you pay for something just to burn it? Y'all got money to waste being racist and shit.

On the flip side it's funny all the people praising Nike for this ad campaign but ignore the fact they use sweat shops
was my favorite company for anything clothing, but now they are endorsing an athlete who depicted cops as pigs on socks he wore. Enjoy losing millions of dollars in lost customers including me
create a sneaker with pigs in a blanket? Sick!Just Do Do It!
Are doing great after the freak out. Which I remind you was due to a discontinuation of an outdated discount program. Yeti was REPLACING the program with an easier platform the NRA could customize for their members. We all know that that went.
You know, if we could just convince Colin Kaepernick to endorse the drugs that treat high blood pressure & high cholesterol I think a lot of the problems in this country would eventually take care of themselves.
McCain funeral is over. Liberals have forgotten their fake patriotism, real Trump attacks and quickly embracing Nike using foreign child labor to make money from Americans to promote anti-American agendas
Damn, where was the Nike boycott when they were cleaning house with sexual assaults and shit. You people are fake.
I understand the point of the However I will NEVER understand why some of you would burn/destroy your Nike apparel when you PAID for it with the money you WORKED HARD for! Just stop buying their stuff, but dont mess up what you paid for!
Dus dezelfde mensen die alsmaar emmeren over snowflakes en liberal tears, wenen nu vanwege een campagne van een multinational?
You cant claim to not be racist and support. Why did take a knee again. its ok I'll wait.
How about we focus on something that actually matters? September is month not month. Cmon Man.
Down over 2% for the day. Just the start. Hahaha
This is dumber than choosing Kaepernick as a role model/hero. People need to stop trying to get their way using social media mob justice - DUMB.
More like "JUST BURN YOUR NIKES" Why did you DO IT, ???
How about we focus on something that actually matters? September is month not month. Cmon Man.
Bugger.....Id make run for it but I just set fire to my last pair of trainers!
Same. It just sickens me that is using as their face considering he doesn't know how to show respect for this nation or its police. Disrespecting police while wearing their products.
Well at least now we know how to spot racists in the crowd. They are the losers who have holes in their Nike apparel. Seriously, if your that sensitive, go donate clothing to Vets.
There are lot better reasons to support a than people are now doing
Interesting that . My money's on them winning this gamble - they are serving a global market and the taking place in the USA won't bother them one bit in the long run. In fact they've probably seen revenue spike in most other markets today
... The brand to wear if you hate police officers and love to support communism.
Anyone who even thinks this is going to effect sales youre ridiculous lol
I think the ad featuring is incredibly powerful and moving. I applaud Nike for and all the angry white men who support can go back to screaming into the wind. The rest of us are moving forward!
You got me! I what shall I do? The real people who run this economy make decisions of importance run business and hire people . We have decided no on your guy no on Nike. Watch the stock price take a shit!
DAMN YOU DYSLEXIA!!!!Ive just ruined a perfectly good bike
In all seriousness, what in the sweet flying fuck happened to this country?
It's piteous seeing overweight middle aged men and venomous suburban moms use Pat Tillman's likeness to try and condemn and , completely neglecting the purpose of his sacrifice whilst referencing it constantly. Look up , please.
Id like to take advantage of the idiotic to promote my debut album Banty Road on iTunes, Amazon Music, and Spotify now! I welcome all skin types, genders, ages and/or class of person to enjoy my diverse music in hopes that it exhibits love.
I just thought of another thing that's stupid about this Why didn't you idiots do that the same time you boycotted the NFL? They make the official jerseys for the league.
Dear white people the same energy you have towards have it towards police brutality...oop. Sorry forgot this boycott means you condone it. Sucks to racist huh
how disgusting.
Just Do It!
I just heard NASCAR hired Kaepernick to drink Budweiser on a Fox News helicopter. Your move boycotters...
The people who are burning Nike products and will wear Adidas in response to the Colin Kaepernick partnership have the same mindset as the people who burn crosses and wear identity-hiding white masks and robes.
I don't buy or wear Nike because their brand is synonymous with child labor and capitalism.

To all you half wits destroying your OWN Nike gear becsuse Backed Colin...just remember the guy who convinced him to kneel was a former SOLDIER!! He stated thats how they honor their fallen friends....
You know you can just donate your shoes to the less fortunate instead of burning them.
Before you throw away or destroy your Nike gear (Converse, too) consider donating them to vets, children or families in need. They dont care about you political BS, they just need decent shoes. Stupid .
I have no idea why people care about the and try to discuss it logically. and stopped listening to logic long ago. is overpriced crap. Thats a logical reason to boycott. I dont own anything from them.
Those who buy Nike Top of the line items and made Nike as big as they are STAND WITH Kaepernick and Kaepernick stands FOR them. This is a win for Nike, Kaepernick and the African American Community. Good for Nike!
Don't buy Nike simply because you don't like low-end shoes!Your feet are just too important to trust them to a low-end shoe.Buy cheap made anything, but not your footwear.Nike is marketed to low IQ individuals like Jake Tapper and Chuck Todd.Be smarter.
Im done with Nike. Just threw my favourite Jordans around a phone line.
Nike uses child labor & slavery in its factories. This is Phil Knight, Founder, ex-CEO & current Chairman of Nike showing his "concern" about it.Maybe Phil will talk if this goes viral or maybe he'll hide.Spread this and let's find out.
Thank you for your decision to support . His continuing efforts to bring injustice to the attention of us all is important.
So are veterans burning nikes ? Or just random folks, with no understanding of why he kneeled in the first place ?? they support everyone
Anyone participating in a is proving exactly why was kneeling in the first place: because too many white people value their songs and flags and privilege, above the lives of people of color.
boycotting a brand, sorry, THE brand, for supporting a figure that stands against racism?wtf is happening to humanity? burning your Nike shoes doesnt cost Nike shit, it costs you paper and fuel, you idiots.
Nike might as well have just called all white people racists.
When I go for my kids soccer cleats, socks, ball, etc., guess who won't be buying ? I will be sending an email to their teammates please do the same!
I see peeps who can make huge statements by boycotting like Too bad all us harmed with are either too sick , hushed by lawyers or sadly already dead
Never mind that Nike outsources almost every manufacturing job to factories and sweatshops overseas with unimaginable working conditions, I'm burning my shoes over a Colin Kaepernick ad and posting it on social media for likes and retweets. Because I love America.
Give your shoes to a small charity. Don't burn them, you selfish cunts.I'm not a fan of Nike using this guy as the new face of the brand. But what bugs me more is this will all be forgotten about & boycotters will buy Nike again.
I have to laugh at the people cutting up and burning their Nike gear. You're purposely destroying stuff you paid your own money for in defense of your racism. It is hilariously immature and pathetic.
LOL at all the maddies burning their dingy Nike socks and t shirts. Youre disgusting. I Stan for , and super Stan for and .
What do you know about sacrifice? Do you being a white man know what it feels like to be looked at suspiciously based on the color of your skin?
Spent last week in a part of Africa where so many are barefoot because they can't afford shoes. Back to "civilisation" to find people are burning their expensive shoes because they didn't like an advert.
People tweeting that they'll just stick to their Chucks, are the best! Lmao, I love Twitter so much.
Will never buy a Nike product again. Shame because I liked their stuff but I cannot tolerate them supporting a racist, anti American piece of garbage like Colin K. Nike feels they can take my money but hate me because Im white and American? Nope
If you participate in just because they support kap you're honestly racist and unintelligent.
I support ! Im not here for this BS! Its stupid!!! Let me go get me a pair of Nikes today.
is proving exactly why was kneeling in the first place: because too many white people value their songs and flags and privilege, above the lives of people of color.
is a brand company, not a shoe company. Their business model is exclusively to monetize buzz. When you buy Nikes the cost is 5% shoe and 95% marketing. I can't because i'd never buy their crap. RT from 1986.
Yall mad at Nike? While your president is a racist, sexist, fascist, sadistic, misogynistic pompous??

if someone could post a video of themselves burning Nike stuff while eating In-N-Out burger and using a plastic straw...heads will explode.
If you really feel some kind of way, send me your Nike gear and I will personally take your stuff to DSS where some kids can wear it and a few homeless shelters here in the upstate where I know some veterans are! I will send you my address of come meet up! SERIOUS!
Just when you think the nation had reached the bottom of the abyss the surfaces and proves there's an even lower level.

If you wear Nikes buy stock in Nike. This is an opportunity. It will at least rebound to where it was trading before the
Beyonc√© is trending above and its hilarious.... Shes literally too famous for her own good
y tho? What will it do to hurt Nike? All you people are doing is giving them more publicity and buying their stuff to burn it/ but it. Just y tho?
The same Americans burning products are no different from the KKK members that BURNT CROSSES ?
Best part about the is now I won't have to worry about wearing the same sneakers as a racist mom who walks in the mall for exercise. Throw em out, Carol. More for me.
WOW - the tweets are unbelievable!!! These boycotting morons support a LIAR President who sacrified NOTHING and made up LIES about taking a knee. WOW - this country is FUCKED UP RACIST
Adidas has been waaaaaaay better than Nike for awhile now. Easiest boycott ever. A brussel sprouts boycott would be easier.
Time to support and by buying a Nike item and donating it to a homeless shelter. That's what I'm doing!
Adidas and Nike took two bold endorsements moves. Are they trying to connect to the consumer or to make a statement? Are you for self empowerment or are you for justice for all? Remember it is impossible for two positives to make a negative.
If you just bought Nike shoes, return them. If youve already worn them, and cant afford to buy more new shoes, remove the brand before wearing them again.
New balance is made in the usa
WOOOOOWWWWW SO AS SOON AS YALL HEAR THAT NIKE IS SIDING WITH KAP ABOUT RACIAL INJUSTICE, YALL WHITE RACIST ASSES START BURNING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING NIKe? YALL A DIFFERENT FUCKING BREED.
Talk about liberal crap pushing its opinion on the rest of us that well be on he wrong side of history. Dont forget that even though Nike thinks its old white people that will boycott, its those same Americans that pay for their kids.
Kaepernick wore socks depicting police officers as pigs. Is it now your company's official position that that cops are pigs? Because he's your spokesperson.
I'm going to boycott Nike. Not because of but because their shoes don't have any Arch support.
is BS. I support . Guess all these fake outraged morons missed the Pat Tillman ad. I also assume they donate money and not just opinions to actually support veterans and veterans associations. This ad campaign is brilliant.
I don't support the I'm coppin some Air max after work

How can anyone even think that is justified but 's kneeling isn't?
Tim Tebow has the exact same argument as Colin. Few remember that Colin was a failing QB with an ever declining QB rating who couldn't grasp defensive coverage and was throwing INTs. Before the anthem kneeling Colin was playing like a "on the bubble" QB

guys guys.. lets not engage in friendly fire here :-) we are all on the good side, obviously this campaign is for a good cause and is bad... so lets not fight amongst ourselves haha... plenty of Cult45'ers to deal with :-)
Republicans. You cannot boycott and actively support a president who bashed McCain. It is absolutely absurd, and makes you look so sooo stupid. So go ahead, burn your socks.
Trump has duped his favorite undereducated voters into believing that this is about the flag or veterans. Forget that he was banned from owning an NFL team because of his mob connections. Continue to do his bidding, while he gladly humps the flag, you so love.
All those participating in the , boycotting by burning their previously purchased gear... youre just burning up hard earned money... stop being petty. Ol racist m-effers
When will companies learn to stop mixing business with politics? Doesnt matter what side youre on. Youre just splitting your consumer base. So stupid
There's so many amazing layers to this. Personally my favorite is this jerkoff trying (and failing) to act superior over a female in the NAVY while his userpic is him standing in front of urinals while wearing an ill-fitting and wrinkled shirt. *chef kisses fingers*
Hey (people boycotting ) why not sell your merchandise....& you use to proceeds to help Flint get clean water?!......you know the less privileged to a kneel for..
Those of you who are boycotting Nike, please recall the last three words of the Pledge of Allegiance, "justice for all."That's what taking a knee is about.
Kaepernick. Really?Nike obviously didnt think this one through.
Never again.... You cant disrespect the American Flag and not suffer the repercussions!
Nike makes Kaepernick face of campaign Yall : THIS IS NOT WHAT AMERICA STANDS FOR!!1!! WE WANT JUSTICE !! Police Brutality Yall :
5 years from now when the world is wearing new balances: Mommy some poor kid was wearing shoes with checks on them.Conservative mom: yes baby. Believe it or not they used to make 35 billion a year worldwide but thanks to us they barely exist.

This just means more clothes/shoes for me
Go ahead and do ur and burn ur shoes i was tired of smelling ur musty tennis shoes anyway

Nike, you FUCKED up. The noise from the left is just that. NOISE. There are way more of us who despise kneeling assholes like Do whatever you want. But I will never buy anything from Nike again.
I gues we will be wearing in our house from now on..
So he paid for some socks and then cut them up (tbh it looks like he hacked them up with kiddie scissors)?? ...and he's a 'former Marine'? Gawd 'elp us :S
For those of you burning your perfectly usable shoes today, why not donate them to someone in need? Burning them is such a waste and selfish thing to do. Grow up and act like an adult.
I support Nike's courage. I'll be purchasing some Nike goods this week.
Waking up to the trend & almost spilled my coffee. Laughable! Like Nike will suffer from any boycott lol!!! For every person that boycott Nike there is are new customers maybe from Adidas or UA that say I appreciate what u did for Kap!
So intrigue me tell me exactly why yall are boycotting Nike? Why are yall sooooo mad but its ok cause clearly DGAF about yalls opinion.

I love how it's now PC to make sweeping generalizations about people so long as they have little melanin in their skin.But no, the could also be about Americans that want sport and the anthem to be places devoid of politics and just about enjoyment and unity.
Americans will not tolerate our nation being divided by disrespect of the flag under which and even have prospered! on you!
The folk must want thingy to starve, or sutn. Tf leave the guy alone, dipshits
This is actually hilarious. Nike stocks have lost almost $4 billion in market cap today so this is a good buying opportunity. Were gonna make so much money off these whiny children $NKE
Conservatives call US snowflakes when were outraged by the President demonizing entire demographics, attacks on young survivors of school shootings, and pushing the country to the brink of nuclear war. But you go all burn it all about Nikes spokesperson?
Im just glad they dont make motorcycle boots because this whole trend could affect my next ride.
Now Nike has been backed by , how (un)American can u get? is in full force! USA doesn't back terrorists & ctys that do!
As black as you are you looking real milky. So the fact that claim 7000 black on black crimes happened Means what? That it's ok for innocent black people to be murdered in cold blood By law enforcement? What in the House Niggah is going on today?
I would love if this will make by RunDMC to start trending if for nothing else because I love that song

How can you boycott Nike but can support a racist president !!!! Colin is for equality and trump is not !! I support Colin !!!! I stand by the knee!,
Hey people, if you really want to show Nike you mean business, you should buy new Nike stuffs and cut out the logo or burn them. Then, do it again and again till they listen to you. You know, sometimes, you have to take a stand.
Hit NIKE HARDER!!!Ask: What companies or organizations use Nike products exclusively?Just like "advertisers support" these companies also need to feel heat for supporting Nike.Kaepernick hates America. He blames all Americans for racism.Nike supports this.
Too bad about the shares, though I suspect it will only be a short-term dip. As for those burning shoes and drumming on about the , you are pathetic.
Why dont they just say it! Just Be A Bitch
Nike using Kaepernick as a poster-boy only goes to show that intelligent people don't care about what ignorant racists do. Burn Nike's products all you want, Trump-suckers. You're not affecting anything but your own wardrobe & wallet.
Why do I feel like Im going to have to spend the next three days explaining brands, branding, and marketing to tens of thousands of people? Ive devoted the past 25 years of my career and life to branding, brand developing and advertising.Try me.

If you apart of this its because youre racist. plain and simple.
Just ordered these awesome running shoes...in honor of Colin...
So many better running shoes on the market than Nike especially if you have wide feet.I prefer Brooks and until recently was running over a thousand miles a year. Take this as an opportunity to explore and find new shoes that feel and perform better
Rus put pro-Nike post here, anti-Nike post there, now sit back and watch Mercians rage at each other while Rus laugh.

I will never buy Nike products. No, not because of Kaepernick. I'm fine with that. It's because they're too damn expensive. Swoosh logo must be made of diamonds.
if you support this you're a massive racist sorry i don't make the rules
Its a genius marketing move on Nikes part to use a polarizing person as a spokesman. Everyone who agrees, will buy more in support, and everyone who disagrees, will destroy their Nikes, BUT in a year from now, will forget and have to purchase Nikes all over again
I would like to see every other athletic shoe and apparel maker come out in support of and . Would be a whole bunch of naked, shoeless, angry folk running around screaming , .
Says the little man talking about giving stuff to homeless while I'll be donating $20, 000 this year poor little boy just a useless man working for divide. NOW THAT'S AN ADVERTISING PLATFORM FOR A CEO LAWSUIT
hi everyone taking part in the of burning and cutting your clothes, can you please donate to veterans homeless shelters instead? Since you obviously care so much about them! thanks!!
GOD! I just had a horrible thought! What if goes against ! If they stop using them? That could result in more Conservatives procreating!!!!!! Nooooooooooo!
, of all sports leaders of both colors who use their time and money to help people, Nike would pick Kaepernick to represent their brand is mind boggling. His only contribution has been to disrespect our flag and the men and women who have died for our country.
Shit. I was trying to cut the logo off my Nike shirt, but the hole is now just a bigger, flesh swoosh on my tit.
Kap took a stand for us by taking a knee . Now we must support him and buy as much Nike apparel as possible! This will not be successful !

I'm sure all the people involved in the are SUPREME athletes, just like their hero Archie Bunker
The biggest problem I have with isn't Colin or Nike, but the division of Americans into this side/that side. A House divided against itself cannot stand! Whatever happened to middle ground??? This won't end well.
Isn't it funny how in America a black man in a Nike ad gets more people offended than the fact that Nike uses Chinese slave labor to make their products.
Now that all racists are burning and no longer wearing , It will become the coolest and best brand of the apparel on market lbs. I have always exclusive wore their shoes to hoop in, but now I am making a statement wearing Nike Gear. Kaep Up
Its funny how some in the United States feel their dollars only matter to a billion dollar company like Nike
"Just do it."
Kaepernick is garbage just like Nike. Seems like a perfect fit!
I will not be buying anything from Nike. I am donating anything I have to those who need it because its already paid for.
Sadly a boycott effects more than just the corporate it effects all kinds of employees through out the entire brand .Manufacturing , sales etc.
just like the Dove products I own, Ill own Nike products; even if other non Nike consumers judge me

and - I want to actually thank you. Thanks for your irresponsible decision, the decision-making process for me when purchasing shoes just got MUCH easier.
Plus, you seriously think that by burning Nike's socks and shoes and products, that will actually make a difference? Nike made a shit ton of money in 2017 and the majority of you people bought the products, so you might as well be burning your money away. (34.35B)
I'm boycotting diapers to own the libs. Shitting my pants until we get our country out of the hands of the Deep State.
If you're dumb enough to want to burn or otherwise destroy your Nike gear at least be smart enough to donate it to an organization. Lots of people could use that stuff. Plenty of veterans and homeless could use good footwear.
Just say no! No Nikes for me!
Wow, I wonder how long it will take b4 Nike fires the genius behind the Kaepernick ad
Talk of will hurt stock, but I think it will help sales. I'd guess they know all too well before doing this that their customer base is behind this move. Stock will recover as sales numbers come in.
People are doing a - what they don't realize is that wins regardless.Boycotts are silly - you need action! Cutting up your old socks doesn't count. Now you just need new socks. What are you going to do: Switch to or !!
Colin Kaepernick's latest advertisement is receiving quite the response from both his haters and supporters.

I haven't witnessed a bigger traitor to our Country then since Benedict Arnold tried to surrender West Point!

Just tossed every family members shoes in the trash.
Meanwhile, I just threw all my Nike gear in the washer. Still wearing it. Just do it
I aint boycotting Nike over Kapernick if you cant truly understand why hes taking a knee or better yet you wont take the time to understand the true issue of racial injustice in America than maybe isnt the brand for you Nike understood
Even though Pat Tillman was a liberal they would've hated this because they hate our Military. Regardless of his political affiliation, he was still more of a hero to me than ever was.
Im starting to think people just wanna be mad about something..
Dems turn everything into a circus.
Nike supports cop haters
When I see people supporting the I assume these are the Nikes they wear
Nike is brilliant.Just think of all those shirts and shoes and everything else people will have to buy again after they settle down and realize that they actually like the products and an ad campaign doesn't make a product worse.

When did Kap start wearing that Afro?From the get go? No. It started with him sitting, being upset about his career situation, that he was no longer the starter. The Afro and stuff came around because he had to backup that social excuse he pulled out off the fly.
Yes because burning your shit that you paid for using your hard earned money will show them. Find a new slant.x

To all of the and all this bringing up of child labor, etc, etc. How come it took you this long to stand against Nike? How come you're just now boycotting their brand had you known of such conditions? Just tell me that.
Brett Kavanaugh you're fired.Chuck Grassley you're fired. you're fired.If you think we need a Supreme Court that represents all of us, you're hired. Thats just my and on
I will be one buying more Nike shoes and socks, because I like the shoes
Yall REALLY just want black people and marginilized groups to sit down and watch people kill and belittle us and because no one wants to do that it enrages you klan members . Its 2018 get over yourselves .
Nike has been donating to Planned Parenthood for years, supporting a genocide. Yall are just getting mad now over kneeling?
who bought 's garbage in the first place?Never Bought It, Never Would. Don't Buy It PeopleJust Screw It
Calling on all the professional athletes in the NFL and NBA who support Kap to buy a thousand pair of Nikes each and give them to the boys and girls club, charter schools, and public schools with football programs. Lets shut this boycott down!!!

I'm willing to bet that all of those dads who wore their Nike Air Monarchs while grilling their burgers and brats this weekend are wishing they hadn't burned their shoes. They already went to get some NB 624's only to return them b/c they weren't the same.
Anyone who thinks nike hasn't considered this from every angle and taken a purely business decision needs to remember to take their nike clobber off before burning it
Kaepernick caused a conservative boycott of Nike. Not child labor or exploitation.
Can someone explain what's going on with Colin Kaepernick and Nike? What's the uprise about? I know nothing about football, so maybe I'm just out of the loop. I just see all this stuff and I was confused. What's the big deal? What did Colin do? Why are people mad?
music:
Just when I begin to feel like were recovering our values, I wake up to this. Our values are so f$& up in . History will show that Colin Kaepernick is our
Buying opportunity. Like white middle America wears much Nike anyway.
sorry, not buying any more of your merch. You're sowing seeds of division and weakness. You have taken a clear side with an anti-police, anti-law and order, anti-American individual such as who has based his negative perception of law and order.
I am going to support Nike even more now :)

what happened im so confuse
racist white people really have nothing better to do than pretend to boycott NIKE just to stir up controversy and push their fabricated agenda.
the people that are saying theyre done buying nike products are the same people that say tHoUgHtS & pRaYeRs after shootings they forget about a week later.
I was part of long before there was a hashtag for it. Okay...it wasn't exactly a boycott. My family was just always too poor to afford any Nike apparel, so...if you're gonna boycott Nike and have any Size 11's, holla!!
sacrificed NOTHING! He was a washed up, sideline QB, that caused racial divide and damaged the . Pat Tillman sacrificed ALL! is an embarrassment to Tillman and all who served.

Although i dont know much abut this controversy but even if people want to destroy their Nike's just give'em away to a homeless dude who needs it and is not giving a f*** to this issue you are helping a greater cause and being a patriot
Whoever thinks this is gonna work is stupid as much as I dont like Kapernick mostly because he has a gay ass Afro Nike will always be getting my money cuz the clothes and shoes are dope af
1. For the most part, the biggest companies are run by liberals.2. They think most Americans think like them, because theyre in a bubble.3. Big companies keep getting blinded sided with hits to their bottom line.
started years ago for me. People out here arguing Nike is for equality, reality is only for equality of earning from customers. All those sweatshops and you wanna act like Nike is a good guy. HA
I know that y'all butthurt over putting kap in a commercial but for the love of God try to at least take them off before you burn them You're embarrassing the rest of us white people
Here's what Americans should be outraged about today instead of and whether and his colleagues stand or kneel. Spoiler alert: Your POTUS is a lying sack of camel spit.
This is making me run even harder and longer in my shoes just so I can wear them out faster to get my money out of them and then switch to a new shoe company.
Can we stop using people who have passed away for our own political commentary or gain? They're no longer in a place where they can speak for themselves & decide how they feel about topics, so how is it respectful to attribute them to your beliefs? CC:
A look at the live reaction of executives & staff reading threats by a insignificant number of rednecks who have been wearing the same thrift store sneakers for 13 years
The same types of racist pieces of human garbage leading the today - were throwing rocks at MLK in the 60's. They were ultimately rendered impotent by history - and the same fate lies ahead for their chromosomeally challenged brethren
Awwwwww when you just don't understand.... its okay sweetie. Help is on the way.
Took your advice to "Just Do It" and I have-dumped my Nike gear.Your brand no longer represents anything that I want to have anything to do with. Looking forward to my new non NIke Fall workout collection which I will be out shopping for today.
Instead of burning all your Nike stuff, can you just give it to me? I've been needing some fresh kicks
People boycotting Nike cause of a ad...... please burn ya self with the shoes
Hey I hate to point out the obvious but at this point you need me to point out the obvious
You racists dont give a shit about the flag or the troops who risk their lives so you can be a racist piece of shit.. You just dont like blacks people
Don't worry, , this is just their boycott of the day. They will 'sneaker' back to buy/wear them at some point. Remember "1984" - today they hate EastAsia, Tomorrow they they are convinced they were at war with Eurasia all along.
Damn, can you imagine if the fake patriots burning their Nike gear were just as mad about racial injustice and police brutality?
Lol this boycott is so funny I me white supremacist think burning their Nike shoes is gonna make a difference?? Your burning your own clothing they arent losing out since you already brought it and trust Nike will never run out of business but Atleast this is funny
If want to loose 50-60 % of their customers, that's on them. Like they say, Just Do it.
Ill be sure to purchase today. Dont need a thing, but I support them for taking a bold stand against injustice.
dear conservatives, please stop triggering me by destroying your own beloved personal belongingsdefinitely don't post pics and videos of it on here and tag it 're owning us so hard that we won't be able to recoverthank you,the snowflakes
White Nationalists: You libs are such delicate snowflakes. Go back to your safe space.Also white nationalists: BRB, gotta go cut the logo off my socks because put a black person on a poster.
When you get excited over the because you think its going to be about their criminal labor practices, sweatshops, and exploitation but then find out its just because the whites hate Black people.
Liberals who dont think the boycotts hurt must have missed the recent news of Dicks Sports admitting that their anti gun stance hurt their business.
Still trying to figure out how who exactly gets owned/self-owned more if you burn a shoe, racists using shallow patriotism to whitewash police brutality, or a corporation engaging in virtue signalling to divert attention from its abusive sweatshops
on is biased. Every top feed is posts in support of nike and a slam on people of patriotic standing.
The fact that all these dumb ass retard losers are destroying their Nike gear makes me laugh. They should band together and form their own company and make "Retards" shoes--the Shoe for Retards! Are you wearing your Retards? Fuck off, losers.
I just cannot understand why a company, like Nike, would go out of their way to alienate over half of AmericaOh well.. Nike, don't look at this as a boycott. Look at it as more of a goodbye...
If Donald Trump was truly a great businessman, he would introduce his new shoe line today.FEATURES:- the shoes come in white- made in China by one of Ivanka's sweatshops - extra cushioning for those troublesome bone spurs
Uh just to put it out there, Ive been for a while now. Lol .. but with this whole Keap situation it just makes me happy that I support a brand who supports EQUALITY.
I haven't typically bought sneakers. I also try not to be swayed by the ads, but I support Colin Kaepernick for his stance beyond sports.Next time its Nikes for Me!
Ok, so the is about buying some nike stuff and tearing them apart to own the libs?USA trending topics never cease to amaze me
Hey if you are planning on destroying your nike clothes you can just give them to me instead
The shows the caliber of people are. They are willing to destroy their own clothes just to "stick it to libs". They do so under their pretend concern for like my brother and father rather than, say, donating those clothes to veterans organizations
Thank you Gigi,i believe in Dharma which is Good karma. no nike no body can dare to insult men&women in blue. i forgive them for they don't know how many times they have been saved by the same ppl they loathe.
Go ahead and participate in the . While youre at it, deliver your fresh Jordans to my address because youre not worthy.On a real note: if you dont get why we kneel, youre clearly part of the problem.
I cant participate in the cause I never got their products to begin with....
Kids working in warehouses apparently wasn't enough. But this did it.
Oh, great. Just when we hoped to get the wildfire season under control, and now, the . Looks like the billowing smoke will never end.
Boycott Nike!Can we get 1 Million to Like & to support Veterans & America & Police (Since & Hate Them) ? Stand For Our National Anthem NOT us
How are you mad at a man thats standing up & fighting against racism, police brutality against the black race and all the social injustice bullshit people have to go thru because you are white and matter more than everyone else
So sick & tired of the disrespect shown our flag & our country. Enough!
I won't be buying any Nike products or watching the whimpy NFL. All who support Kaepernick, go into your job tomorrow and kneel in the middle of the floor and raise a fist in the air for just 30 seconds. Then get your resume ready.
aku kena simpan dalam robok smua barang Nike aku ke camne ni? Btw, boycott sebab apa eh? *Melayu sgt ko boikot tp x tau sebab musabab.
Im out, I cant support you anymore, Ill be burning my shoes tonight and switching to from now on.
Exactly my reaction. Never worn them before so this may be an exceptional excuse. Great advert for from the though!
Like, we get it. You're a company of racists. Stop trying to sell us after we've already said yes.
Kaepernick started to kneel in 2016 and for the longest time he didn't have much support, yet he kept on going.He sacrificed everything.Such display of courage and integrity is rare.Believe in something. I believe in Colin.
The left doesnt wants to destroy everyone who thinks different. We must respond with the samesun strength to the traitors.
happening in this household. Good know before start if fall sports buying. Way to go
is really a trending topic this morning??? Yall are really out here burning shoes and clothes because a hero and leader is the face of Nikes anniversary campaign? Yall... are really that mad...
Do these people burning Nike stuff not realize they already paid for the product? So...they are the ones losing money. Maybe theyll find a groupon for logic. ...I support
What is it with us White people and boycotting? Starbucks. Target. Disney. NFL. Now, Nike. I know Im not the only one that knows this outrage will last 3 whole days before we return to our regularly scheduled lives.
The most divisive figure of the last year is your representative athlete? No more Nike; buy European brands - Addidas, etc.
is a smart way to boost attention on an overpriced gimmick brand. Hey, Social Democrats and Justice Warriors, youve been punked into the game of Nikes marketing campaign. Perhaps yall should take a knee.
All these videos and pictures going around, it makes me wonder.. Will any of them post a video of them give their gear to homeless vet or donating them the charity? Or is all this he disrespects the veterans/flag/anthem just talk? Pointless rage or give back?
Count us in. We just trashed 4 pairs of and 10 pairs of socks with the swoosh on em. Stick up your ass. We'll buy again. SB
Just Do It 's Kaepernick Ad Has Cost The Company Over $4 Billion So Far | Zero Hedge
I just find it funny people think burning and cutting up their shoes and socks that they already purchased is actually doing anything
I love that most of the Tweets and are in SUPPORT of Nike and Colin Kaepernick.
Everyone boycotting Nike is just showing how racist this country is. Kap never disrespected the flag, his action in taking a knee was to bring awareness to injustices faced by people of color.
The is just plain dumb!
Liberals destruction of logo is the desired result so stop with your sanctimonious BS about donating. I donate thousands to charity and time each year. Get a job, itemize, and grasp the situation dummies!
Confused. Colin Kaeper¬≠nick is new poster boy for Nike & motto is ? Thought his motto was
If you're calling for a you're basically condoning police violence and racism. It's that simple. Don't try to defend it. Just admit you are a racist.
Boycott Nike all you want, they're just fine without you.
The world will never be the same please -
The same types of racist pieces of human garbage leading the today - were throwing rocks at MLK in the 60's. They were ultimately rendered impotent by history - and the same fate lies ahead for their chromosomeally challenged brethren.

Wonder if the same people who burned their gear burned merchandise when he disrespected Jon McCain. But please keep burning your own stuff. Its hilarious!
Are you going to boycott because they own ? Skip and LeShannon are for Kaep...
Conservatives are fucking babies. Cutting off logos from products they already own beacuse....?
Instead of burning or destroying products, you could instead give them to poor people so that they now have crappy political products that they totally cant use. In fact you should buy more in order to donate them to really say fu to Nike.
Calling on all the professional athletes in the NFL and NBA who support Kap to buy a thousand pair of Nikes each and give them to the boys and girls club, charter schools, and public schools with football programs. Lets shut this boycott down!!!
not that i get political too often, but instead of burning shoes for something stupid.... DONATE THEM!!!!kars4kidssoles4soulsanywhere but wasting shoes that people in need could use
without Nike 8 year old kids would not be able to work 12-hour days for a dollar and Poor inner-city kids would not be able to spend $150 on shoes. remember when they said used sports to divide us?
Dumbass bots that are burning gear please just donate it
I just purchased 2 pair of nike shoes
Calling on all the professional athletes in the NFL and NBA who support Kap to buy a thousand pair of Nikes each and give them to the boys and girls club, charter schools, and public schools with football programs. Lets shut this boycott down!!!
Boycotted Nike and Grilling was never the same
Burning or destroying Nike products is ridiculous, they already got your money. Basically you're burning your hard-earned money.
WILL FURTHER ERODE NIKES POWER IN THE INDUSTRY
If you no longer want it, donate gear to anyone who can use it!
I guess Rosa Parks was just mad at busses.
Nike and Kaepernick are wrong. Violence against blacks is from other blacks, see Chicago. White police abuse is small in comparison.
The weirdest twitter trend is destroying your own property because youre mad people are being treated fairly.
I refuse to be manipulated by Donald Trump.
The film does not include the USA flag and Armstrong's son and astronaut Buzz Aldrin support it.WHO OWNS EARTH'S MOON?See: 1967 Space Treaty
I'm going to by more Nike gear just to watch the Conservative Snowflakes cry.
stems from people not having black friends or family members. If they understood the message of kneeling and just addressed it, life would have just gone on. Its such a mess to clean up... Here we are. Thank you though ignorant racists... You make it easy to see you.
Am I the only person who's opinion on literally hasn't changed AT ALL, positively or negatively because of being a piece of their new ad campaign? Like... who cares? was and still is better anyways.
tchiiip moouuaaahaha grand bien vous fasse hein..... mais ce sera sans moi
Nike is un-American!! a trump supporter screeches while burning their shoes, a confederate flag flying outside their house
excuse my language but I know there are a lot of lying MF out here, or a bunch of bare feet lying MF out here. But not one of you burned or threw out those shoes.
let's in Nike gear today because
Nike $NKE is down 3% - you know that.BUT did you know that It is up 51% in the past 1 year.It is up 146% in the past 5 years.And 47,017% since 1980 AND A 1% dividend. $NKE
The is more proof that people care more about political stunts than actually supporting the troops..
Im new to "because I said so" trend but please explain to me exactly HOW kneeling is disrespectful. I keep racking my brain for examples of kneeling before *insert literally anything* is disrespectful. Ex. Injuries, ye olde king time, at CHURCH
I will just not buy any more Nike product
't buy Nike, they support people who disrespect our Flag
All the trend suck today. ? Get a life. ? Stupid. ? I mean, ok? Let's start a new trend. How about . Don't even give context. Just Tweet it.
RuhRho... Down Up. Anomaly or Impact of Let's keep watching See what happens. Money Making opportunity.
Here's a gif of people who thinks will suffer any loss because of
! If u are against Nike nowbecause you still don't understandthe message, instead of destroyingitems you already PAID for, pleaseDonate the items to local sheltersfor the homeless !
Ill buy Nike before I buy Jordans (just do it)
Why doesnt Nike put that much money behind the troops that stand up to anything versus kneeling for everything. Cant support a company that would turn their back on our Country.
Maybe, but maybe its the fact that our bothers, sisters, moms and dads and grandparents sacrificed there lives for this country. I will always stand for our flag and our country. Stand
Dear racists,While youre ripping, cutting & burning all your Nike items, dont forget to take that floor-length, solid-white robe with the pointed hood & destroy that too. Please JUST DO IT, you have to trust me on this one...
I refuse to burn my Nike clothes, shoes, etc. that sh*ts expensive lol
The same types of racist pieces of human garbage leading the today - were throwing rocks at MLK in the 60's. They were ultimately rendered impotent by history - and the same fate lies ahead for their chromosomeally challenged brethren.
In my eyes has raised its profile. Just bought some $NKE stock. Respect. not!
Just do it.
This whole is pretty dumb. Not because people are doing it or anything, because people are destroying clothing and shoes they paid hundreds of dollars for. A boycott is staying away from something, not destroying it. The staying away is supposed to destroy it
. Nike is paying Kaepernick because he is black and gets lots of air time. Thats sad. No team wants the problems he brings or his bad attitude
I was just at Dick's Sporting Goods looking for Nike Clothing. It was too expensive. However, I'm making it a point to go back this weekend and ball out. I'm here for the support Nike is giving Kap.
Praise where praise is due: Nike and Kaepernick7 show character mattersand that starts with putting skin in the game. The is for people who support looking the other way in the face of injustice.
I love this so much. Nothing like watching a bunch of mouth breathers interpret "DON'T GIVE THIS COMPANY YOUR MONEY" as "DESTROY STUFF YOU ALREADY PAID FOR!" Then they complain about us calling them idiots. Go nuts, ya dummies. Nike is fine lol.
Sure. I'll just buy Asics, New Balance, Converse, or any other competitor. It's not like there aren't options. I'll go with the brand that does NOT associate with someone who wears socks with pigs dressed as cops.
Any company that tries to be the sjw virtue signaler, is going to get hurt financially. Liberals dont have any money to spend anyways. Now the only customers with $ i.e. conservatives, arent going to shop there anymore...
I fully support and against the
Shout out to the trump fans who think people on the left wing of politics would be upset at them boycotting a multi-billion dollar business that uses poorly run sweatshops, child labour & tax evasion...as famously all these things are beloved by socialists...
How dumb people can actually be? They are burning their clothes because of an ad? We seriously need another flood.
Trump supporters are boycotting Nike... because who wears gym shoes to a cross burning?
If it really was because of Veterans youd do this instead of that bullshit torching Nike gear I kneel with
Lighting your Nike shit on fire is dumb. They already got your money you burning their shit won't help your dumb cause lmao. Give it to the ones in need.
Everyone stfu about this..... NIKE will keep on going but your dumbass will have to buy new shoes because you burned your last ones....
Hello people those that are supporting Colin Kaepernick are being duped and being used by corporate and political facism proably lead by Obama watch and learn ypu dumb ass liberals.
Why havent you already BEEN boycotting Nike for:- Using slave labor / pennies on the hour labor in China - Made in dirty, fossil fuel factories polluting the Earth- Shipped via fossil fuel across the ocean to U.S. contaminating our oceans
Hey if all you all boycott nike people really wanna support the troops my Try Cash App using my code and well each get $5! LQBBFBL (link: ) or just cash app me money $danjamesv
are you changing your slogan from just do it to just sit on your butt and whine because you got fired for not doing your job? Also, you can replace the Swoosh with a joint.
Nike has military discounts has nothing to do with us.
I applaud Nike for hearing and listening to the message, "Police brutality and racial injustice are problems and need to be addressed." Instead of the bastardized message, "disrespecting the flag, anthem, military blah, whatever, etc "
Okay seriously what is wrong with you people these days? Okay look I know Kaepernick is kind of a "bad guy" and stuff like that. But are you seriously gonna burn your Nike apparel over this? I love my Nike shoes I'll never hurt those.
A very simple VOICE OF REASON from ! WONT MISS MY BUSINESS BUT A FEW MILLION WHO DON'T BUY ANYTHING "NIKE" might drive home a POINT OR TWO!
There are more important things to worry about than this .... seriously... this is AMERICA TODAY!
So you 45 supporters that are SEC football fans, y'all boycotting college over this NIKE campaign? Because I'm 100% certain your teams will be wearing NIKE gear.
Get over it. Just do it.
Exactly! Stop using our veterans as a mask to disguise your racism. Kap kneels for all injustices, including the mistreatment of our veterans.
I wish would support so I could see the angst of people debating if they want to give up them F-150s lol
I'm laughing at these idiots who are cutting the nike symbol out of their socks. These are the same morons who last year burned their nfl jerseys and threw their expensive keurigs down the stairs.They already have your money! You are only hurting yourself dumbass!
*SCHOOL JUST STARTED* How about instead of torching shoes and clothes that cost an arm and a leg- we make videos of taking them to goodwill? There plenty of kids who would happily benefit. Kids who normally couldn't afford these luxouries that we so quickly destory.
Stop using the deaths of my brothers and sisters to further your racist agenda. Veterans arent the only heros. is standing up for what he believes in. Dont speak for us.
Schumer held a coordinated phone call telling them to disrupt. The guy just read an NBC article on the matter. wow
Are you gonna burn your $190 Air Max Vapormax Plus?
! So Y'all boycotting Nike because of a Guy that Boycotted? So Is it ok to boycott or Not because Y'all were quiet when Nike was accused of abusing kids in sweatshops
At first I thought you were disrespecting the flag, but now I understand its not about the flag, obviously. Its bigger than the flag, but people dont wanna believe that.
I served 8 years and support YOU Sometimes you have to "lose" to WIN. Thanks for never sacrificing your integrity. Love always wins....
White people are racist because they have nothing better to be. They hate because everyone hates them. White people think they are the Superior race. When really they aren't shit. To all those that hate blacks or any other race. i hope your kids marry non-white.
Im guessing the folks participating in a are folks that never owned Nikes to begin with. They dont sell them at Walmart Cletus.
Praise where praise is due: and show character mattersand that starts with putting skin in the game. The is for people who support looking the other way in the face of injustice.
Donating two unused pair of shoes and 1 brand new pair work shoes (many on the left won't get it)'ve lost a life long customer and thank you. Thanks
I'm usually not a boycott person, but I'm a LEO spouse and the stats don't back the "cause."
Y'all scream because is the face of a campaign, and that's all good...But uhhhhhhhhhh...Where was that same energy when BLACK MEN/WOMEN/BABIES were getting their heads knocked off by police like a wicked game of whack-a-nigga?!
" oh we just burning nikes "
Never was a fan of Nike until now. Thank you for standing up for the real America. I do NOT support . Nike and Kap will prevail as they stand for truth.
Im all for boycotting but mainly because of their use of sweatshops. Although I disagree with his methods, signing a guy who is fighting for social injustice is not going to get me to burn $100s of dollars worth of shit I bought with my hard earned money!
I was finna buy more Adidas products because the brand has gotten better but Im all about the support for Nike!! Amazing job.
Red necks cutting up socks from Walmart because thats all they could afford
Like for real tho, the people boycotting Nike are the same ones wearing those New Balance 401k kicks that Kanye bit off of. So really no loss there guys.
I've loved seeing the fallout of the new ad campaign. I reckon if Nike followed it up with "Just Jew It" they'd finish most of America off for good.
Brett Kavanaugh leaves his house with....an ADIDAS bag. via
This has nothing to do with troops, songs, and the flag. This is about injustice in America and I appreciate for supporting the true cause and correct narrative. - A Veteran
Enormous Facts - Black Bruce Wayne
If youre posting openly about throwing away all your gear today, Im just going to assume that youre stating you are racist.Oh, and instead of burning your clothing, why not donate it to the veterans you care SO MUCH about?
All XL tech gear must be sent to to be included in
Never bought Nike products, I will now. Greatly respect their solidarity with 'a dude' who stands up against racism.
Schumer held a coordinated phone call telling them to disrupt. The guy just read an NBC article on the matter. Kavanaugh Hearing
Yall, - a better idea is to donate your Nike items to - Then it will help people, flood the market with products which will lower the price, and I will get some slightly used Nike gear that doesn't hurt the environment or my bank account.
Every year sends thousands of back packs and shoes to the Bahamas for less fortunate children
Brilliant you just lost a 20 year customer who also buys for 5 kids, never coming back.
It is beyond me how could see the damage he caused & make a business move like this besides theyve now exposed their character.
Hi Nike, Instead of the slogan just do it...... why not use this one lets all behave. Promote behaving vs. disrespecting our flag!
Boycotting Nike by burning all of your Nike gear? They don't give a shit. You've already paid them for that. Don't be silly. Just stop buying their stuff.
If you are upset with Nike this morning you should really step back and admit it is because you are racist!
I think everyone should be more worried about kavanaugh and not sneakers? If you Seriously want change than pay attention to more important things than a sneaker company? Do something for your community?
Nike doesnt care if you burn the sneakers, they got your money, the only people hurt are your parents cause now they got to buy you new shoes.
- does this include boycotting nazis & white supremacists or no? Nike's world wide revenues: 34.35 billion USD. US Revenues 15 Billion. What amount by Nike Burners? Who knows-but they already spent the money (dufuses). Already determined not significant
For all you trump-tards participating in a , how about donating your stuff to an organization specializing in clothing/feeding/preparing veterans for jobs? are just a few. I donate once a month. You? Or you just want faux outrage?
We live in a country thats so RICH & SPOILED we can burn clothing. You know how many teens in my youth shelter would LOVE to have your products!!! Talk about privelege! Money to burn clothing cause you can buy more clothing!
Whatss up Everyone..!!!Need LOGO or T-SHIRT design For business Contact here FOR ORDER (Please Check portfolio)
I like my Nikes medium rare because IM NOT A FUCKING ANIMAL, KAREN.
Buying today just because
Nike is off our shopping list. Used to love their hats
Im just tryna find out why ppl out here burning shit...
I wear a 10.5 in kicks, large in shirts and shorts. Inbox me for an address to send your new or gently used Nike gear
as long as you support we will no longer be putting our hard earned money into your product!
Im guessing the folks pushing this are more the last years maroon pair at Marshalls kind, as opposed to the I could get shot for these fresh Jordans customers. Nike sales will be just fine.
I posted this on my Facebook because I know many haters have the same size shoe as me!
burning the damn things and just give them to the homeless. I'm sure they could use some shoes and cloths.
So, all these rich kids burning their Nikes couldn't have just donated them? Rude.
if you don't think has analyzed and over analyzed the publicity (whether its positive or negative) from partnering up with Colin Kaepernick, you are a fool ... this was a calculated play by industry giant that has been brewing for months ...
When you already bought Nike products its not a dummies. Just like fans who ripped there season NFL tix beacuse of the .Actually JUST DO IT and hand them over to Veterans instead of buring or trashing them
Whoever supports is clearly racist not opening their eyes looking at the bigger picture.
When was the last time a actually worked!? I think the is just another one of those bullshit overreactions to something over hyped and overly politicized. I just cant even.
So many better running shoes on the market than Nike especially if you have wide feet.I prefer Brooks and until recently was running over a thousand miles a year. Take this as an opportunity to explore and find new shoes that feel and perform better
Not a fan of boycotts, but shouldnt use  view on genocide as an advertising slogan.
Nike is the only brand of shoe I buy. I will not be joining the because I don't give a shit about their ad campaigns. They make damn good products. People take things too seriously these days.
It's easier to boycott Nike and act offended rather than to actually face reality and admit that injustices are being committed everyday against the Black Community in your own backyard.
Ohhhhhh Nike, you just signed your paperwork! Shame on you! shouldve been the face of Nike!
Liberals are complaining about the . Arent you al doing the same thing to In and Out Burger?
38.9% of the world is at war, and the internet is ripping up $400 shoes because Nike hired - a guy who kneeled during the anthem. Get it together people, know yourself.
Supporting a belief through violent behavior in opposition to supporting a belief with non-violent behavior is how you promote violence and get stupid high on fumes.
Calling on all the professional athletes in the NFL and NBA who support Kap to buy a thousand pair of Nikes each and give them to the boys and girls club, charter schools, and public schools with football programs. Lets shut this boycott down!!!
Just do it!!
Im kind of boycotting Nike too, but because Im broke.
babies are boycotting things. Then why are they able to vote?You gotta be over 18 to vote. They sure dont act like it. Must be mature to vote
U cant see the forest for the trees. U cant look past the comforts of Ur own life to see things from a different point of view. Labels are often used to deter and smudge the truth. Try not to continue walking through life blinded, no matter how ugly truth can be.
is yet another example of how genius Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is
He doesn't have a point, he thinks Nike being down 2 points in shares because people saw trending is going to put them out of business. As you can see...it isn't.
I am disgusted with renegotiating a contract with such as scum as , he is a disgrace to: He is a POS who needs to clean the bleachers of
if yur jus throwin away/burnin all yur nike items I jus wanna let yu knwim acceptin all donations DM me for addressPeace & God Bless
You're burning shoes. You could donate them, and the weather is getting colder for homeless vets. But you're burning them...to show you support vets. What in the everloving hell is wrong with these people?
Middle aged fat rednecks losing their shit over an ad campaign. I kinda reckon your lack of future custom will hardly register
Symbolism over substance used to belong to the left. The pendulum swings back & forth, shuttling the sides to pointless extremes. Burn them if you must, remember they already have your money. Be mindful of your surroundings especially draught areas.
Nike should have used this guy to sell merchandise. They will now lose millions.
Gotta luv the new campaign celebrating the anniversary of the "JUST DO IT" slogan featuring as the face of this timeless message. Salute to Nike & for those who are supporting the thank you for exposing the real you.
Yep, nothing finer than watching with GREAT amusement while people burn shit they already paid for..... To own..........oh never mind.
If you're burning their gear, how about donating it to , , , or I'm sure some homeless vets could use it.
Just ordered 2 new pairs of lol
Everyone who supports need to go out a buy some Nike Apparel so we can show our support!! Lets ban together and make a difference!!! Thank you !!!
: appropriate brand of shoes to wear to work today.? Nope. Why would anyone boycott a company that's aligning itself with fighting racial injustices?
This is just another distraction from whats going on thats not being reported.
This is so stupid yall must be bored
I would be more than happy to destroy all of your brand new to gently used size 11 Nikes for you. DM me for where to send them
WTF?? First, they're smashing Keurigs??? Now a Nike boycott because of an ad w/ Kaepernick? Get a grip, people!Is Nike still using kangaroo leather??
Im just gonna leave this here for posterity.
My eleven year old heard about the , and said thats ridiculous, it reminds me of when they called for a boycott of Hamilton.
the only people that are participating in the or are mad about the Collin Kaepernick thing are the racist ones just saying
I will do the not because of But because it cost an arm and a leg and it's made in some warehouse in Malaysia.
stuck my Jordan when his shoes were banded by the - they are not new to this. They also know a majority of their consumers are supporters. Oh, and destroying Nike items you've already paid for is stupid.
Anyone in support of the
I know we're all focused on the but meanwhile some state leaders have sued to end the (Wi, Tx, Tn, Ms, Mo, In, SD, ND, LA, Ut, Ga, Ne, SC, Ar, Az, Me, Fl, Ks, WV.) This would eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions. (1)
possibly, just possibly, 's stock fall today reflects more on the stockbrokers and hedge fund managers than it does on Nike or .
Let's be honest Nike had been garbage for a while now quality dropped and prices went up. Poor design shoes all look the same and have awful foot support. A hoodie cost $80 a dry fit T-Shirt is $45 and the fabric falls apart quick.
Was seriously contemplating wearing s to my job interview today... no here.
Im definitely not going to pay $119.00 for a pair of shoes that fall apart after solid wear only to light them on fire because some dead ass conservative turd merchant wants me to
I find it hilarious these dumb fucks who burn or cut their clothing to boycott after they've already spent their .
I support Nike.I would love to have convo, whether public or private as to why someone is boycotting Nike over the Colin Kapernick campaign. Im assuming their stance is tied to their ego more than anything else, but maybe I could be wrong..... I doubt it though
You can tell a lot from the people that are because of .
And if you hate me because I support him, then you already hated me before he took a knee. /3
Has anyone seen the average supporter? No way any of them own any Nike athletic wear
Watch out for a market reaction to , as price dips caused by sentimental circumstances often create opportunities for savvy investors. $NKE
I try not to get into politics on here, but this is one of the dumbest things ever. People are burning their own clothes because who Nike put in their advertisement.People are fucking idiots!
If people are so insulted about signing Kapernick and want to boycott, then also boycott who Nike sponsors like the , and whichever team/ sport uses their product. We all know you wont. Just a bunch of fake outrage.
The funniest thing about is that all jerseys are made by , so racists who are so angry about their support of will still be supporting both by buying/wearing jerseys. Even if they manipulate the logo, it's still Nike.
Congrats Nike! The tyrant of Iran, Amadinejad, supports you. Great job!
Yall need to stop worrying about the and get focused on your own life. Worry about YOUR growth.
Hit them where it hurts! u really lost millions of customers w/that decision.Lets see how fast u can file bankruptcy!
Jimothy Frumpton has the best idea. Since history has told us people will always be outraged at this sort of thing, why doesn't every single buisness do it? Soon we'll have the burning and destruction of toliet paper or alcohol. My kind of apocalypse.
This is what you applaud JohnnyMy friends cousins uncles brother & father are NOT pigsHe sacrificed nothing; HE opted out of his contractWonderful how disrespect, petulance & literally doing nothing to help is rewarded by a Nike contract
Southern Black Student Union supports Nike and all that they do for our communities! Dont burn your money when people are homeless in our own communities
The is just the latest tantrum to be thrown by a buncha malignant mothafuckas hell bent on spreading the disease of racism. If you wanna call a boycott against someone whos disrespected our flag and veterans, like the late great John McCain, Boycott this president!
Ya ever been so upset at people kneeling for the National Anthem that you just stop shooting unarmed Black people completely? ?
Take a knee for our fallen and stand for our country when you see progressive stupidity and hypocrisy 's board of directors should be replaced with critical thinkers.
won! Take note America, if you get off your knees and fight back against the bully pulpit you'll realize that they're power is mostly an illusion.
That's kool but more for me Boycott is just making yall hunkies look stupid is making his money so let him & make it together
I wont be burning my  gear, Ill be returning my $500 order. This is disgusting.
Wut u think about ANTIFA?-terrorists who hate USA! How bout BLM?-troublemakers who hate police! What about NFL players who kneel?-Disrespectful SOBs hate our troops! & white nationalists who chant racist terms from WWII?- Fine ppl on both sides!SERIOUSLY?
Aren't these boycotters usually wearing New Balance anyway?
Rather than burning it, please donate your unwanted gear to organizations supporting veterans.
Read over the tweets. Look which side is cursing and name calling. Its amazing. It starts out as a civil discussion and then comes the cursing and name calling from one side.
Corporations make strategic pro business decisions. knows exactly what its doing... is trending, has Trump taught you nothing?
Lets all rush out and buy just to show President Trumps supporters how much we value his opinions
I wonder if the military vets going along with this boycott are also waiting for the US government to care enough about them to provide proper health care?
is symbolic to Bloody Sunday. Some preferred us to never cross the bridge.
Some of those with tiki torches, are the same that cut sockses
These white folks are crying in my mentions like I care. They know that they have NO reason to participate in the they just dont want to admit that theyre racist.
White supremacy is in so deep with their idiotic behavior over the humanity of human beings.... just keep going with your ignorance its scary but funny to watch
Because we havent learned these lessons enough...
Racistas querendo causar um bem no Daqui a pouco Lemonade t√° de volta ao no iTunes.
Quick PSA to the geniuses: Take your Nike's off... BEFORE you burn them
This is a perfect example of a tweet showing why our country does not get along with eachother? Only people who dont respect the flag will support kneeling during a national anthem WHAT A DISGRACE!!!!
Going shopping today for Nike gear in support of a company who understands why America is and has always been truly great ... thanks for reminding literate Americans !
my ass Nothing but KKK coming out the wood works literally I support
Whatever u wanna think snowflake. You obviously have never been in the military. Because you would know kneeling for the flag is the worst disrespect that you could do.
is courageous for doing this campaign with if hasn't given the green light this has brought out the remaining
Me waiting on the Nike store to open so I can go and support + dont participate in this
Aye tell em we aint worried bout what they talkin bout they aint serious. . They burning $40 sneakers. Tell em burn some vapormaxes or Jordans if they forreal
by for our country
Erased all the contacts with the name Mike Or Mikey in my phone cause its too close to Nike to own the libs.
This who say that its disrespectful to our troops and our flag are the same people that support a man who attacked McCain a war hero and said he likes this who where not captured... attacking our POWS. Fake outcry
If you really hate enough to cut up and burn their stuff maybe think about just donating it to one of those countries populated by brown folk that your boi called a shithole.
Above us only sky
I don't typically react to various company's politics. I am not the boycott type. If wants Kap...and his endorsement sells shoes...more power to them and him. I like Nike shoes. I will buy them if I like the style, and I have a need. .
Before you throw away, or burn your NIKE brand shoes think about a donation to your local Veterans Affairs Center, Homeless Shelter, or a Women's and Children's Shelter. Here's an opportunity to voice, or act against something, and still have a positive outcome.
An injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.How do you feel about Nikes sweatshops, ?
These racist love trying to divert the conversation to something it's not. His boycott has nothing to do with the people who serve! I AM ONE OF THEM WHO HAS JUST COME FROM A YEAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST! Thanks to everyone showing their KKK robes
Seems like the tag has taken an interesting turn. People supporting has taken it over . I guess "conservatives" have to come up with something else
really Nike?? What about our soldiers that sacrifice on a daily basis? Kaepernick didnt sacrifice shit!! No more NIKE in my house. Soldiers should be in your campaign. Tell me, what did Kaepernick actually sacrifice? Nothing!!!
For all of you leftists pissed off at the conservatives that speak up about kap kneeling during the anthem chew on this...his mother hated it. But that's none of my business
How are peeps burning their shoes because of a brand ambassador? Does it affect shoe quality?
Check it out! abir69 will do simple eye catchy business logo for $10 on
Hey all major gun manufacturers just endorsed kaepernick there you go America I just fixed your gun problem.
A bold move by Nike. So will become a hero, or just a smart marketing tool for some profit?
LMAO at you dumb Assses could donate your Nike gear to homeless veterans or kids living in the street instead of burning it. Oh wait some might be black so you wouldnt want help them out either. ALSO Nike dont deserve that clout they just in it for the money
You're not mad about players kneeling. You're just uncomfortable being reminded of your bigotry.
usually sport these, but since u used Im happier to wear these. Screw the republican snowflakes crying about it.
Everyone gonna start throwin these other expensive brands in their bonfires to?BC is more than just the swoosh. If you really wanted to hurt a corp. ACTUALLY boycott. But no, lets just burn stuff we already bought instead? Really hittin'em where it hurts boys!
There are many people that could be using those shoes. If you don't want them, give them to the less fortunate smh
boycotting Nike for 40 years.Slave labor child sweat shops is your idea of "social justice" not mine.Get that $$$ KeapernicModern Slavery, don't care.LolFools
StarbucksStar WarsHamilton HawaiiKeurig...and now, ?If you morons cared as much about Veterans as you pretend to, why not DONATE those Nikes to needy Vets instead of destroying them?Y'all just like burning stuff, don't you?
The tweets run the full range from thoughtful to sad to hilarious. But anyone who buys gear and then burns it truly is an idiot who doesn't understand what's actually going on.
Why is it conservative's first instinct to just start BURNING things they want to boycott????
a company that stands with us. Try donating to the you claim to care so much for. Just don't be donating to kids .... I think we all know how you all treat the kids. ConSeRvATIve RACIST Can't be one without the other
to those people who want to burn their Nike products , why dont you just donate them to people who are in need: like the homeless vets and vets living in poverty, instead of pretending you actually care to cover up for you racism.
Take a knee, go buy something from Nike. Just do it
Supporting Adidas or Rebooks while you take part in the is the most unpatriotic act of all time!
Gotta love the Nike boycott, Daddy Phil! Burn those shoes you already paid for to instead of donating them to the veterans that you care about because you really need to
Folks wearing clothes but taking the logo off cause what they really care about is someone knowing its Nike.Ohhhh...Just like racist people like being racist but dont like it when people call them racist cause they really only dont want people to know.
Thank you for supporting . The only man who has lost his career for standing up to police for killing black people. Thank you.
GOD! I just had a horrible thought! What if goes against ! If they stop using them? That could result in more Conservatives procreating!!!!!! Nooooooooooo!
so.. how exactly are yall explaining yourselves for this situation??IM SO FUCKING PISSED AT NIKE! How DARE they support equality & fair treatment of ALL American citizens wtf! Im burning all my expensive Nike shit. THATLL SHOW THEM!this is how you sound.
Maybe instead of destroying your Nike gear, if you really don't want it, why not donate it to a homeless shelter? I'm sure one of the thousands of homeless veterans who've honorably served this country could/would use them.
„Éª„Éª„ÉªYou would have had the support of the entire country... This Is America
This just shows how real the racism is in the USA. What a fucked up country. Well done to Nike!
'm in. If they want to support trash. Then I'm not buying.
CUT MY NIKES INTO PIECESTHIS IS MY LAST RESORT sure is hilarious
IM IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE MAYBE NOW THEY WONT BE SOLD OUT AND HAVE MY SIZE IN STOCK THANKS DUMB FUCKS!!!
Hmmmm just wondering why nobody boycotted nike when everyone found out nike has children workers. Who work 16-18 hour days with no breaks but I guess a taking a knee is way worst lol.
Seriously Fuck Nike! Im burning all my gear!
Lets be clear. The people that support the bone spur, draft dodging, dont know the anthem, disrespector of gold star families, reducer of vet benefits prez & his flag rhetoric dont support racial justice anyway.
and , you both disgust me. I love watching your stocks fall. Let the American people keep burning their Nike gear!
I remember it came out years ago that Nike uses unethical slave labor to literally make everything they sell. Barely anyone batted an eye then, but God forbid they support a minority standing up against police brutality
You have suspected white supremacist having this and changing the narrative to "the flag and veteran" if they cared so much about veterans, why didn't they donated or helped a homeless vet out? Ppl would say anything else when it comes to non justice of blk Americans
This is a perfect example of what to do if you want your business to tank. Stock already down like 2-3 billion? Good job Nike. Now I know what NOT to do in business.
Wearing my suede today simply because I want to. If I boycotted every brand that used a controversial famous head I'd be naked, hungry and homeless. Idgaf about the guy in the ad. I just like my shoes.
A couple people got shot and killed, then someone else was executed. Now people are just shooting off their mouths about police brutality when they don't know what they are talking about.
has made a singular decision with full knowledge it will divide people. And will get blamed probably
Those left of center that behave in the ways mentioned often get their way and businesses cave to mobs as = mob justice which is not justice at all, but those of us with logic and sense do things differently
Nike is Liberal and Phil Nike will see who will win this battle, I'll never purchase another Nike Product, especially when The Under Armour CEO came out and Said about Our Real People President, that the Business Climate is 100% better since he took office.
Great, now I gota throw away all my Nike wear. On the plus side, its a great way to start a fire.
Nike is a billion dollar business. You think they give a fuck yall burning shoes and shit lmao.
Its... its not a boycott when you already gave them your money. Youre just destroying things you already paid for.
Just means I sacrifice my Nikes no big deal
I'm never giving up my Chucks because of some guy that took a knee and have millions to charity. By all means keep burning their gear. It'll help pay for his endorsement.
Nike just learned that aligning their brand with an unpatriotic loser is bad business.
Hey stupid, Instead of burning your gear why don't you donate it to the less fortunate or better yet the homeless veterans that you support so much.
People burning their gear because of the ad campaign is peak snowflake stupid.
There are needy people who could use the items y'all destroy
Its dumb burning youre clothes over what one so called justice warrior does. Its also really dumb to accuse all those who support the boycott a racist. It doesnt make me a racist when I still have no idea why he kneels and what he is trying to change. Its .
Do yall really think a Global brand like Nike didnt run extensive cost-benefit analysis on signing Kaep? And yes, they wouldve factored in that a handful of angry twitter users were going to to try and ruin them. The benefits obviously outweighed your tantrum.
All of you making this about the military are just hiding your ignorance and intolerance behind the flag. Its never been about the military. Im going to keep using my military discount at the Nike outlet near my house as you keep burning shoes you already paid for
Man, I wish I had some Nike's just so I could burn them with thermite!!Much better than burning a 'hand'...
all y'all taking the profit from your stock help someone in need. Less than 50% of Americans own stock, so this tells me who you arewe all own shoes. Might just be an undercover buy back.
I wish this senseless would lead to a second launch of the Just Do It collection huaraches in a size 5.5 Come thru sneaker Jesus. Dope shoes matter!
ooops? NYSE: NKE80.04 USD ‚àí2.16 (2.63%)
Kaep kneeling doesn't bother me one bit, but to say that he "Sacrificed everything" is ridiculous. He was destined to be a back up QB, and instead now he is making more money working for Nike. The guy is doing just fine. His charity work is worth praise though.
 stop using us to push your racist agenda.
Liberals will tell you that if you boycott Nike you must be a white supremacist. Progressives are such hypocrites. If you dont bake a cake for a couple homos you will get sued out of your house. But by God Colin K is a patriot you bigots!
just threw away all my gear and wont be buying anymore Nike
I worked in corporate strategy at Nike for years. Nike's most loyal and lucrative core consumer? Black youth. Not the Trump supporter cutting his socks with pruning shears. ? The company is laughing its way to the bank.
If every grocery store and restaurant supported would you guys just not eat?
- Wow...looks like Nike just jumped on the sinking ship that is the NFL and ESPN. Added to the boycott list!
yeah I don't think so. In fact I just bought some Glitter Nike Air Max. Keep up the good work You just won another fan/loyal customer.
I don't like Kaepernick because he introduced politics into football - one of the few places I used to escape from it.
If Ford had just announced Kaepernick was their new spokesperson, would these idiots burn and smash their F150s out of respect to the flag?
I love to laugh. Thank you Can you imagine the calls cooperate is dealing with.. The emails. "I've been a loyal Nike customer for 30 years, it saddens me..."
Exactly!!! Seriously what is thinking????
To everyone participating in the listen for a secondI don't have a dog in this fight at all, but just consider something. Rather than ruin/destroy/burn your Nike stuff, why not donate it to people who need it? Plenty of homeless/poor who could use it.
Just watched Fox News and it's really sad that Colin Kaepernick called all of the troops "little sissy boys" and that he thinks our American flag "look like a fat clown's ripped underpants". So disrespectful!
The is just as much a part of outrage culture as idiots bitching about comedians
Aww white people getting mad again. Just wait until his shoes drop. Blacks will buy those MFs up . We set records. Black panther to Obama.
Just Do It... did itRed Hen did it did it did it did it did it
Go ahead, you angry, little, uneducated, MAGA racists, including you Big & Rich--Just. Do. It. Have your . The rest of us all together are Bigger & Richer, and support AND .
So the folks cutting the Nike stuff up are the same ones rooting for black athletes? Don't be a hypocrite. Blk folks own sports. And if dont own your sport its because we dont care to play.
Great discussion in class today about against which isnt a boycott at all.
Dont forget that all your NFL jerseys are products also, so have fun burning the names of players who were once members of any branch of our country's armed forces
People can be mad all they want but at the end of the day will always be there. Please to many black people need their gear, so it you racist want to burn shit up your really just wasting your time.
So all of the fugly, middle aged, white women are boycotting because of Colin Kaepernick...... Ladies, Nike doesn't make sketchers shape ups or those plastic shoes that you just hose off at the end of the day. Bye!!
Yo you guys messed up. Im burning everything I own thats Nike in a giant bonfire. Im willing to help others too. If you have any lightly used or new golf polos (L), basketball shorts (L), or basketball shoes (size 11.5-12) send them over and I gotchu.
„Éª„Éª„ÉªYou would have had the support of the entire country...
Just ordered $200 in school clothes for my daughter from . They'll make back every dollar lost to the and then some.
Just Do It
The neo liberals have arrived! proves how we have "white privilege". Kneeling during the anthem is about attention and disrespect. Colin is not patriotic. Hes an asshat. A disrespectful, steroid using asshat.
1) Burning your Nikes because of an ad is wack2) If youre gonna get rid of them anyway why not donate them? Plenty of kids in America that need them
Just donated every item I own to . .
. The fact that this is a national trending topic shows that too many people are irony impaired. Youre mad at Nike and making them lose sales because they are supporting someone that gave up money to support something. Prove their point much?
Can't we all just get along???
hey fellow nike boycotters, send me all of your nike products so i can burn them all together in a huge pile. dm me for my address
I was a loyal Nike customer since I was a kid (40+ years). Positive change will only happen when people stop blaming everyone else for everything. Not by disrespecting the flag!
But have you seen the people burning gear? They seem to all have the "mad because they are ugly" affliction. Awww. Poor little ugly people.
Twitter is trying to change to another hashtag. They don't want trending. So trying to confuse by suggesting another hashtag as you type in . So slick and soooooo transparent.
Ya'll are whack AF. How much have you spent on all this stuff? America's whack, your own Pres. doesn't have respect for your soldiers. HOW ABOUT you donate your Nike things to them instead of pretending about caring and just catching the clout from burning Nike vids
Stop burning your Nike shoes just because someone did something you dont like politically. Its stupid. Get help.
Nike actions have consequences. But more importantly is that their shoes suck. They are of low quality & overpriced. Having compete at a high level in running Nike were poorly fitted shoes & just couldnt last. New Balance & Addidas better shoe
Genius .....stock-3 already
If you truly support veterans, which is presumably the issue at the core of this entire , consider donating your clothes to a veterans org instead of destroying them. If you're destroying Nike clothes vs. doing something useful, what's really fueling your outrage?
Im boycotting Nike because, after all these years, Im still fat. Well played, otherwise.
Hahaha I love the is trending because of the all the ANTI-Boycott remarks! grateful for companies with conscience .
Im so confused by the . I follow NFL and I knew what was happening with Kap but I have no idea whats going on because hes doing an advert? Someone explain please?
Pendant un instant, j'ai cru que le monde s'indignait des conditions de travail des petites mains. Ah non, le , c'est juste des nazillons qui font leur petite r√©volution.
how the haters are raging about "disrespecting" the flag & the military, yet gave nothing to say about dodging the draft with spurious excuses.
BREAKING NEWS:Following the support for leading to - makers of White Hooded Robes throw their full support behind - this will surely lead to people burning their White Hooded Robes.
Wait, what? People are boycotting Nike again? I'm going to have to find a newspaper to read why...I thought I was boycotting them because they're over-priced (read: I can't afford them) and they're made with slave labor...
Liberals yesterday bragged that because they're so smart they figured Nike wouldn't of taken this Kaep risk without figuring there'd bea backlash but said itd be small. Today the stock is tanking. Let this remind you, you don't speak for the majority.
Be patient, Nike. Let them have their ridiculous fits. I plan to order Nike shoes & products for my family in support of your brave stance.
D√©jense de jodeeeer, en vez de quemar zapatillas Nike regalenmelas que a m√≠ me gustan jajajaja
How do I say this...Okay, I got it. If you support the , you support the prolonging of racial inequality, police brutality, and the silencing of voices needing to be heard. And if thats the kind of American you want to be, then thats on you.

Nike has managed to get SOCIALIST Social Justice Warriors to support one of the largest CAPITALIST exploiters of sweat shop labor in the world. Greatest.Trick,Ever.
Regardless of your political stance isnt it idiotic to alienate half of your consumers? Its like owning a business and putting out a statement against women.
WHY do liberal biased tweets always show up FIRST in a Twitter search??? Pushing the liberal narratvie and agenda. This is blatantly disgusting and really pisses me off. Shame on
Funny how those supposedly boycotting Nike are going to support the German company Adidas. Why not an American based company. Skechers, NB or UA
Seeing videos of people cutting up and burning their Nike products because of the new Colin Kaepernick ad campaign. Here's an idea: If you truly believe its disrespecting veterans/those who currently serve, why not donate your clothes to a veterans' charity?
How to destroy your brand image, by Nike... As if their crappy shoes and gear weren't already cheap and over priced enough... They must be really desperate to stay relevant.
But these clowns on here with the rejoicing like it's the end of a company or they can effect that change are the same ones that are burning 20 yr old $20 Nikes in the first place
demostr√≥ que la derecha estadounidense es tan millennial, ofendida y rid√≠cula como los SJW.Un circo de eternos ofendidos siendo unos idiotas.Tambi√©n le demostr√≥ a Nike lo qu√© pasa si se pone de lado de justicieros sociales intentando capitalizarlos.
Here's how to properly:Take your shoes outside, set them on fire, and, as they burn, roast hot dogs over them. Then feed the hot dogs to your family.Then, poop in your Nike socks and flush them down the toilet. As many as you can.
Its also showing that the flip side of supporting this campaign is pure, idiotic, unfair, ignorance and is no way comparable to the position is taking. supporters: YOU LOOK REALLY DUMB.
Hey you rascist jerks! Go and burn your Products. Go and boycott Nike forever because I don¬¥t wanna see anyone of your assholes while I¬¥m buying a new pair of Nikes. FU
These backwoods cousin fuckers would rather burn their shit than donate it to someone in need?
How about you idiots burning your Nike gear donate it instead? Unless of course you want to wrap it around your head and set it on fire then I'm all for it. Just please film it.
represents at it's best. More commit crime than . There is no social injustice just an overpaid, privileged, washed up child who doesn't see the truth. I wear ,
is now the Trending top topic in US. Visit for more hot topics
Nike's new slogan is now "Just Blew It!!"
Think about how much fun this hashtag for would be with all of the burning, chopping off, cutting off with scissors, throwing out the window, if Dicks would have ran the same ad.
Y'all up here burning up Y'all Nike stuff and begin racist because of but does Nike care really
I stand with yall racist ,ignorant people can just go Fuck yourself and your Imma buy even more nikes now so chock on your hate
Seriously there's a ?
Race under Donald Trump is sadly still an issue just as it was under Barack Obama. I hate how everything is political and how America is divided. What does Michael Jordan think of the . Maybe he can unite America!
Dont burn/destroy your NIKE clothes just give it to me Im in need ..
just typical White supremacy nonsense.. burn all the nike stuff you own when these blows over you be back at nike store
People just looking to burn sh*t.. just sounds like a temper tantrum to me..
Yall are quick to destroy your Nike products for likes/retweets, but not quick to donate to the 120,000+ homeless veterans that live in the same country that you love and respect so much
Just. Dont. Do. It.
If you wear socks depicting cops as pigs, you're not even in the same universe as those who sacrifice - or potentially sacrifice - life, limb and livelihood.
This new campaign is great. If people want to go and burn there Nike gear there i hope you can like the other brands out there. The hate is so real that its sad. I fully support this.
Think imma buss out the 97s today
Too early to tell but Nike stock down 2.80% I wonder if its just one of those days or if is cutting/burning their stocks.
Pat Tillmans wife has said to stop sharing her husbands photo as a political tool yet people continue to do so. Says a lot about you people who are for the
Im going to go buy another pair of sneakers.... boycott the and stand up for integrity! is the sports role model I want my son to look up to- a man who stands up against injustice and racism.
If you are a size 13, it would be a stronger statement to simply ship your shoes to me instead of destroying them. Let's work together to stick it to nike!
Please quantify systemic white supremacy. And everyone that partakes in the is a suspected white supremacist? Your entire white supremacist narrative is nothing more than a deflection and a false narrative.
If you wear apparel today, you just guaranteed the slavery of a small child in the Far East. Its just that simple.
Nike chose a side and it wasn't the side of White Supremacist/Nazi's/Fake-Patriots. I don't know what ya'll are so mad about. You can still rock your Russia shirts and dirty New Balance tennis shoes.
Hey, real talk if youre participating in the dont destroy the product, send it to me and Ill get it to someone in need. Im being 100% serious.Dont everyone volunteer at once. I know youd hate to actually help your fellow man.
What the hell has whiny ever sacrificed?? Just another entitled ball player that lost his job. He's done NOTHING in his life. HOW ABT THOSE THAT REALLY SACRIFICED EVERYTHING & THOSE THAT STILL DO EACH DAY?
No more nike stuffz for me not off the entire debate going on just off reading all the tweets telling me how my life is and how it wasn't hard This is racism people and they cant even see it! every one faces injustices!
Stock price falling 3% today ..... working already.Spending Ad $ to join the sinking NFL ship is a titanic fail.Is Jon Jones still sponsored by NIKE - LOL? Because hes stand up act as well.
Gonna buy some Nikes later this week, because they will finally have my size. Btw white people, you all whack
There are legitimate reasons to boycott Nike and none of which have to do with them supporting Kaepernick.
LMAO all ur NFL shop team merch is Just wait this one out, next week your will tweet storm about some new BS to distract you good ole boys from his continuance of Bush/Obama era military policy that he campaigned against
This whole is as dumb as people saying they're going to cancel their WWE network subscription cause they didn't like the result of a match.
I didn't buy Nike because they supported Michael Vick. He was a dog killer. Now I think I'll buy to support .
pays kids pennies in sweatshops to make their shoes while paying an unemployed Footballer millions to kneel at his house.
Just Do It!
Dear White America,Stop using Vets like me as your excuse for the . Stop weaponizing our service for your petty racism. If you really gave two sh*ts about my service, why do you allow me and so many other Veterans to live in poverty?
Seriously! Let The propaganda begin!!!
Nike knows that its structure is built on black culture. They know they need black culture to maintain the soul of their brand. Theyre not about to lose the support of all the greatest black athletes that have multi million dollar contracts with them lol
We demand to be taken seriously as old out of touch white guys burn Nike Air Monarchs they already paid $47 for
So people were fine with Nike using children to make their shoes but sign an outspoken African American and they scream and sell their Nike Stock..
If there is anyone who plans to burn, or just overall destroy their Nikes, dont do that.Ill take them off your hands. Im a size 9. Sometimes 9.5. And with some extra sock layer, a 10. Please and thank you.
America, you look fucking stupid.This is pathetic. Go focus on real shit.
Hi & I have just been made aware of etc. I am now going to buy some of your shoes to run in & wear them with pride. was an inspiration and your campaign is fantastic.
I swear to god, people are finding any excuse to boycott companies nowadays
So to be clear, its fine to disrespect a former POW who served honorably, but kneeling to bring attention to police violence is just too outrageous? Burn your shoes idiot.
Yesterday i just bought some shoes (at Marshal's) but I have to say these are the most comfortable shoes I have a ever worn. Nike Roshe two. So I went back and bought another pair
Nike Stock is not falling. It's just kneeling.
Lmao do white fowk really think anybody still buys the its for the Troops lie they use to hide their true racist colors?
just do it
Just so we're clear: You can't both love America and support Nike at the same time. Pick one or another.
I never seen Nike in no hood helping to do anything. Just clever marketing to make more money off blks adding Kap. Are you constructive or destructive ?
Damn. The United States is filled with fucken ignorant, wannabe political dumbasses.
just do it
Here we go again named as face of 30th anniversary ‚ÄòJust Do It campaign.
sad to hear that Nike has taken a position against our military heroes and veterans, against our National Anthem, against our police force, against the American people that support our President Trump.In short, NIKE SUCKS
Now would be a good time for Nike to come out with snow boots. The offended snowflakes are causing a blizzard in September.
Hey everybody stop focusing on the and remember who they are trying to get on the Supreme Court.
I dont buy their cheap Chinese/Pakistan garbage in the first place. What a stupid business decision.

Hey all you racists doing this and cutting up your clothes because you don't like . Why don't you donate those clothes instead of ruining them? There are millions of families that wish they could afford clothes for their kids.
look into the Reebok and Adidas warehouses:
Stop using the military as a "reason" to . We don't exist to be political scapegoats. is not disrespecting the flag, the troops or the United States. Stop being ignorant and racist.
just tweeted me three whole hearts! I dont give a damn bout your ! All is well with the world. Yes Im fan-girling.
Nike made profit regardless cause yall already spent the money on the gear And my Nike are in need of replacement sooo yall pass them over to me
I wont be buying anything any time soon. As if supporting Chinese slavery in their factories wasnt enough, Nike now supports treason. Cool, Nike, cool. Enjoy your slaves with the democrats.
boycott and continue to boycott the .Crush all Democrats and Democrat run businesses in America.
BAD move Nike:Colin Kaepernick Is Chosen For Nike's Anniversary 'Just Do It' Campaign
Ill just leave this here and see you at 70 to cover
I will purposely be visiting this weekend with my active duty husband & the rest of the non-racists people in our area. Since we know it will be absent of white supremacist. Thanks to their dumb
Yo creo que debe estar preocupad√≠simo con . Cuando recuerdo su marca, siempre me imagino a blancos conservadores usando sus productos.
Welcome to America, where we burn our $150 shoes when there are folks who live here and abroad who buy their shoes secondhand or cannot afford them at all. Say what you want about Colin Kaepernick but this is just plain IGNORANT.
If you're thinking of destroying or throwing away your Nike gear because of the Colin Kaepernick ad, instead you should offer that gear to a policemen or police department in your neighborhood. Call it the anti-Kaepernick effect.
Im done forever with buying any Nike products. I used to buy only Nike until today.
I didnt even know who the previous spokesperson was. I also have no idea what brand my tennis shoes or socks happen to be. It would be neat to live in a universe where I thought about shit like that.
Its crazy because most people in the military dont care if people kneel for the flag or not
Those people who are part of the are the same people who attacked Kap when he took the knee.Just a bunch of racists.
So is gonna be my lifestyle now! Thank you! People who started are afraid and cowards. Bigotry must be defeated. Hatred must be defeated.
Allez-y boycottez Nike, nous sommes l√† a vie.
To the people thats burning their stuff or simply done w/ Nike because of their stance because you think its disrespectful. Theres no way around this one.
Oh no! Not a . MAGAs will put Nike out of business the same way they did Starbucks, Disney, etc.
Trump calls coward and insults a war veteran and is the disgrace to America... are the Trump supports listening to what he says or do they just blindly follow him?
We don't need nike well buy new balance because they are a Class. Act
Any decent person would be embarrassed to be associated with such a disingenuous campaign.
Soyons pragmatique au lieu de br√ªler vos chaussures
People are going to buy their merch in support of their campaign, and dumb asses are going to buy their merch to burn it in support of the . I think it's safe to say that their bank account is about to become larger than ever
Im curious if those who plan on destroying their shoes also believe that the death toll in was only 64.
if it weren't for the fact that I find Nikes to be pretentious af I'd buy a pair or 4 come payday.
Hey Kaepernick haters and supporters..... THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY ALREADY!!!! LOL
The people who support the are the same people who wanted to Boycott Starbucks & were the 1st inline for a Pumpkin Spice Latte this season...
People who fly the flags of two evil nations the US military overthrew (Confederates and Nazis) are shunning Nike for having an ad with someone who is 'unpatriotic'. Interesting.
Surfing Icon Brand, Hurley is a Nike wholly owned Company. I am not a boycotter, I just dont buy from Parent Scum. Check them out, "all American" in Costa Mesa, CA( Headquarters).
The sneaker burnings just shows how lazy the MAGA crowd is. I mean their parents and grandparents burned entire crosses when they were pissed off at black people.
I cant stand these racist white ppl throwing fits burning their Nike gear all cause Nike releases an ad supporting a guy who took a stand for inequality smh let em show they true colors FUCK EM! I bet these the same ppl that voted for trump too
So folks are because they recognized for his justifiable movement against racial profiling & inequality. Yet these stupid ass folks gave aka a pass even though he disrespected their hero & the United Snakes flag.
If you are in support of , I may not agree with you, but please do donate your Nike runners and Nike clothing to your nearest Salvation Army!
Nike decided to make a crybaby, garbage QB their poster boy. The man couldnt even find a job as a backup because hes that terrible. Guess they want the public to know that wearing their shoes will make you feel like a pathetic loser.
Anybody want to donate their Nike gear to me for a huge torching, I am taking all rejected gear and making a bonfire of epic proportions. Just send size 13s tho and XL T-shirts. We going to stick it to the System
The conservative MAGA crowd are loving the because they can now cut the generic Walmart athletics logo off of their shorts and shirts and pretend they wore Nike.
is the toxic communion of conservatism & capitalism in U.S. labor/trade policies & paid moral crisis patriotism. the business of privileging white civil society is publicly torching property & destroying products en masse yet its not criminal or terroristic
Watching rage-consumed MAGAts destroying their Nike stuff to own the libs/hurt Nike is hilarious. Nike already has your money; now you just have less gear. It's also infuriating though, bc you could've donated that shit to the homeless vets you supposedly care about.
Me at Footlocker: I said, give me two pairs, cause I need two pairs
These same hypocrites support a coward treasonous president who had 5 deferments, claiming avoiding STD was his Vietnam = Using Excuse Of Patriotism For Racism
I am not American or a Colin fan,but I like that Nike is supporting blacks. It sends a strong message.
Finally a very powerful voice backing up Kap keep Just Doing It Nike
People are boycotting Nike for political reason. My wallet has been boycotting Nike because I cant afford it.
Just saw is trending and it reminded me...... I need a new pair of Nike running shoes
Best thing about CK launching this ad is that provided him with an image the size of an iPhone home screen. Functional post. Art meant to be used. Super smart.
I'm gonna go to Dicks sporting goods, buy a pair of Nikes, then I'm gonna have lunch at Chik Fil A, and then dinner at Papa John's because......MURICA!
I think is a disgrace to the USA for his disrepectful during our anthem.
White people dont understand they are not the top consumers. When companys advertise is not for them is for us the top consumers so keep burning what you want. We the top consumers will keep buying.
So theres a going on? Nobody cared about Nike using slave labor to make dirt cheap products to be sold for massive profits but false patriotism does it? Smh..
uses/pays a half black rich guy as a political platform yet also uses overseas to make their merch for cheap to sell at stupid high prices to the black communities. Oh the irony.....
Instead of callin it a boycott why not a temper tantrumi used to do this with my stuff as a teen ...you look like this
Do you hate equality? Is your skin color way better than other skin colors? Do you love to destroy stuff you paid for, rendering it completely useless? You're in luck, my friend! Jump aboard the train. CHOO CHOO
Niggas really out here burning their air monarchs , cap really be making them mad because of orange man
It seems, that is going to be an afro-american and immigration in the US lately.
Hey, every Patriotic American who objects to what did but doesn't own any Nike: Go out and BUY a lot of Nike products just to burn them!
Burning shit you already purchased is stupid. You don't want to support them or the brand after their decisions? Fine. Just donate your nike gear to kids who may need it. Don't be animals.
We should change the stars on the American flag to 50 Nike swooshes just to confuse the fuck out of rednecks.
Hey Kaepernick haters and supporters.. Don't go doing the Capitalist thing and try to sell all your Nike gear on EBay lol
I have a pair of Nike's ~ going in the trash. People say we are stupid for throwing stuff away when it can be given to someone less fortunate. Integrity says if you give a product from a bad company you are supporting that co. Give with integrity.
is trash. I support and
New idea for next Nike campaign: Kaepernick and Merrick Garland together, with their arms full of Tearin' Socks for Racists

What wait. Ya all are because someone took a knee over racism and got a deal from Nike. Wtf ya all gonna do when you find out is a Russian agent?
You hit the nail on the head! I love America, the military, our vets and police so much that when a hater like Kaepernick represents a brand, I am MOVED to condemn and join the . If you have to denigrate the US to fight racism, then YOU GOT IT WRONG!
Dear , I could handle the fact that youve abused children in sweatshops for decades, but endorsing Colin Kaepernick is where I draw the line. Me, my wife and her boyfriend will no longer buy your materials.

Oi you ers.. it hurts us each time we see green living grass burning.. go buy whole store and them to SINCE YOU BEINGS HATE ALL LIFE BUT YOURSELVES..
- JUST DON'T DO IT - JUST DON'T BUY IT - NIKE IS A JUST DON'T!!
What I love about hashtags like is that most of the people using it are just ridiculing the morons that are actually participating in the boycott.
That's true. R lost if being supportive of a is more important than being supportive of the man who took a knee 4 the injustices perpetrated against all diaspora. While the flag is symbolic of our ideals.. embodies thm.
If you do the dumb you are trippin because 1. Youre reason isnt good and 2. That stuff expensive
If you're burning your shoes because of an athlete, please make sure your feet are fucking in them at the time.
This just means more clothes at the outlet for me
in doing this is a symbol of all the social justice, anti-America, anti-cop, anti nonsense happening in the culture. won in part due to most Americans being fed up w/this sort of lunacy.
I just ordered FILA shoes, a company that respects America.
I wear size 13.5 - 14. send to me. Just DM me.
anyone that supports the gotta be mentally retarded. Anyone Against Colin Kaepernick need to reevaluate their self. yall moms must a drop yall on yall head intentionally
For those showing fallen soldiers on their profile for what you think Nike supports or doesn't support. Where were you when Trump said, 'I like people who weren't captured'?
Fascinating difference between Kaepernick and Pat Tillman. Many NFL players support Kaepernick. Tillmans squad shot him.
Don't forget to burn yourself together with your items. It's more effective that way.
Because the "other half" Is NOT half of Nikes sales. How many times have you seen a redneck back the truck up for air force ones? LMAO
If is so in to being a SJW, why are they still huge in ? Do they think that customers will ignore that? Perhaps
I'm going to paint the swoosh on my house, then burn it to the ground to own the libs
This dude needs to team up with and be irrelevant together.
Shout out to Nike for supporting Colin Kaepernick how many veterans are offended by Kaepernick kneeling? (Honest Question)
Should Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed as a judge of the Supreme Court? Donald Trump Democrat Republican GOP Chuck Grassley SCOTUS Senate Judiciary Merrick Garland
I'm not jumping on the "boycott bandwagon" all I will say is Nike is not the left best friend ok. It's best friend is the bottom line and it will appropriate/exploit the cause of the day to maximize profits.
Here is why the boss who okayed this decision will be fired.Its not about the money. This decision just created millions of investigative reporters that will dig into everything horrible about Nike...and plaster it all across social media.
RUN-DMC supports the Troops.
Fortunately Nike sells to more pple than just some dumb haters
. When do you plan to offer branded socks from your social warrior? He socks depicting officers as are disgusting. But he is your company spokesperson,
Do us all a favor and burn your Nike apparel while you're still wearing it.
Same people boycotting Nike are the same people saying they have black friends and in laws
Random question..Would the slogan for the still be "Just do it"?
Soooooo does the make it easier to get Off Whites? Because I want those Serena Blazers...

Racists just burning their shoes because they dont have a cross handy
Boycotting 101: Destroying your previously purchased merchandise has no economic implications on the company you are attempting to boycott.Common Sense 101: Donate your no longer wanted attire to less fortunate people in need of clothing.
! Brett Kavanaugh leaves his house with....an ADIDAS bag.
Sometimes its embarrassing to be a millennial, then theres this, and sometimes its embarrassing to be white. As for a white millennial, theres no excuse for you to not be crushing life. I mean come on. Weve been given so much just hit the layup.
Someone explain to me how burning shoes and gear hurts Nike profits. Whether you wear it, burn it or use it for toilet paper, you (I cannot stress this enough) ALREADY PAID FOR IT!
People so salty about the cause of an ad, but we the snowflakes???
Remember When Standing Up For Justice Was As American As Hot Dogs & Apple Pie?
Just remember white people Nike owns Converse and Hurley
Gotta luv the new campaign celebrating the anniversary of the "JUST DO IT" slogan featuring as the face of this timeless message. Salute to Nike & for those who are supporting the thank you for exposing the real you.
How is burning shoes going to change the Political climate in the U.S.A. however, C.K. Use his Social status to bring about awareness to the blatant Injustice of so called black people pigmentocracy vs democracy

y AIMEE PICCHI MONEYWATCH September 4, 2018, 9:21 AM Colin Kaepernick "Just Do It" ad sparks Nike boycott
Interesting to look at the reaction of this on different platforms. The only platform where individuals seem to support Nike is Twitter.
As expected, stock (NKE) is dropping like a stone. East Coast markets opened with a HUGE sell-off. What were they thinking?! Colin Kaepernick isn't even a successful athlete and he's not exactly doing our country proud by attacking our police, flag, & veterans.
PSA while we are burning our Nikes, let not stop there. Chevy supports Colin as well. Lets burn our Chevys too. I want to see how many police officers you can help meet their quotas today for arson. Just like nike. Do it !! $200, nothing lets go to $20,000.
The Colin Kaepernick Nike deal is literally all the coins and notoriety minus the CTE. He is winning
Kneeling during the anthem is a powerful thing. Its symbolic!Burning your Nike stuff is dumb! It doesnt mean anything!Same people
is a pathetic excuse for an athlete disrespecting his country's anthem. Send him to the marines, so that they can teach him some . And after that he'll stand as tall as a tree. Btw I always prefer & over .
I'm just picturing all the white conservatives I saw in the hood buying Jordan's off a kitchen table in front of someones house, like "I got to support the small businesses of the neighborhood." Zero. LOL. Fuck these assholes. Nike doesn't want/need your money.
Kudos to for supporting . I am now a loyal customer. I will buy extra to makeup for the racists that may boycott
Racists really out here mad my whole family is full of veterans there is no disrespect felt amongst us stop using veterans as a excuse esp ones that never served.. dummies burning yall Nike gear hope you all burn in Hell too
no one supported Armstrong's American arrogance like but in this light I'll pass on joining the
quick whilst all the white conservatives are busy burning their shoes we should overthrow the government
For all those just as upset as I am about Colin Kaepernick being the face of Nike, send me all of your mens size 10 Nike shoes(preferably those shoes that lace themselves and some air maxes if you got em) and I will burn them all for you so you dont have to!
Disrespectful likes to and disrespect our country. Maybe our soldiers should take a knee and sent him to the nearest warzone.
Nothing like casting the stones to take your own light off your own demons ! unreal is anyone going to wise up ? And decompress anger and chaos Im just wondering ahh
Fuck a I dont even wear nikes but I might go buy me a pair just to spite these ignorant racist incest back wood cousin fuckers!
Im loving all these tweets, they are hilarious
I know I'm late to the party on this one (par for the course for me), but am I the only one who is "meh" about the Kaepernick, , thing? As someone who has always been of a larger size, the only things I'd usually get from Nike would be footware. (Everything +
Destroying a perfectly good pair of shoes you already purchased does nothing. You'll just have to buy another pair when you come around to realizing how stupid you were to burn your shoes in the first place.
I'm just saying....
Hmmm...most of the people I see Tweeting in support of the are claiming they'll switch to . I wonder why? Are they suddenly concerned about where their clothes are manufactured, or is it something else more insidious?
I've never bought anything Nike...but i could use some new shoes. New Nike customer here
Don't let the distract you from the Investigation, Jews must answer for why they love Putin!
This is the dumbest thing ever. Really? All because they chose kaepernick? You may not agree with his views but I dont think hes done anything morally wrong
In all seriousness what are all these people that are in this going to do with their Nike Air Monarch. I mean most people that buy them are .....
So folks are setting their Nikes on fire because of Colin Kaepernick?I dont agree with the dude either, but grow up, people!
Please consider donating your shoes, instead of burning them. Kids are back in school now and could use the sneakers. Adults who work on their feet all day would appreciate the sneakers, too.
So help me God... do NOT even come at Nike about sweatshops to support your the day after the Kaep campaign is announced, when your ass is sitting here on your iPhones / Samsung wearing your $1 flip flops from Old Navy. WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY CAME FROM?!
If you with the and u have a pair of Nike Air Yeezy's go ahead and burn those. Let's see how much u down for the cause!
fans using as a reason to drop the company due to Kaepernick's perceived disrespect of the flag and veterans - yet they say nothing when Trump doesn't honor a war hero (McCain) by not keeping the flag at half staff . . . such stunning hypocrisy.
They are burning their sneakers because they don't own any books!
Nike is going to be just fine. Sorry racists!
I love how literally every tweet I see on the hashtag is some virtue-signalling liberal talking shit and not someone calling for an actual boycott. Did they just assume the boycott was happening and create the hashtag themselves to parade their wokeness?
Not political post but just far out lame folks. There are literally people without shoes and clothes. Young boys who would do anything for a pair of . Perhaps people can instead ship their shoes to so they can distribute.
Hey supporters, why don't you burn all your clothes and move back to the woods and caves where you came from?
I should wear one of my Kaepernick jerseys to school today just to see how many people I can piss of
You wanna know why i'm not gonna buy nikes shit anymore i'll tell you why. It's because this spoiled rich brat hasn't sacrificed not a damn thing other than his "high paid athlete" career. Anybody can chase a ball down a field it doesn't take a rocket scientist +
If you don't want gear, give it to police: they can use it in their open-truck stings. Then you'll feel better about directly contributing to oppression of minorities, versus your regular passive bull****.
giving nike attention with the or support is pointless. like every big corporation they dont give a fuck about you or the public debate or anything. they just want money. save your breath morons
You got it! No more Nike! They just lost my business.
Nike too damn expensive to be just burning...
that the guy known for "Pig Socks" has been hired by the company inspired by DeathRowInmate GilmoreHow Nike's killer 'Just Do It' slogan was inspired by an actual killer via
You notice that the people posting these boycotts are same people who cant afford any of these things?
Of course corporate America would find a way to take the message of the black community's struggle a/st police, unequal education, imprisonment, etc... and find a way to make a profit from it.
because some NFL guy is not o.k. with ancient U.S. slavery but he is quite o.k. with Vietnamese and Pakistani Nike child labor slavery.
Im not going to destroy my items just because of Kaepernick. I paid for these things. You people are idiots!
Nike-over priced/not comfy, terrorist supporting shoes. my & buy shoes!
The best part about this is that all these ppl claiming that they are going to rock other brands like Puma/Adidas don't know that those same brands were ready to pounce on Kap & offer him a deal if he didn't renew his contract with Nike
Only MAGAts are participating in a the same group that support ztreason, Nazis and bigotry! Screw them
I just left on vacation with my husband an 5 kids & bc of how much we work we do all our shopping online-on our long drive I ordered all my kids school clothes almost $2000 spent on Nike stuff alone-then I immediately cancelled after seeing who u really R
Dear supporters please put your on before burning them, thanks in advance
This is by far ridiculous!
I'm laughing at all these posts because I can't afford Nike without sacrificing a few things (lower standards of living here) and all of these angry people are destroying them AFTER THEY'VE PAID FOR THEM. Just send those my way oh my god
Colin Kaepernick does nothing but kneel while disrespecting our country and all service men and women. Hero James Shaw saw an opportunity to Just Do It -and saved lives.
I've never really been a Nike fan but I do support the latest ad campaign. Guess I will be buying those shoes my daughter has been begging for after all.
kill like it's not a problem!The Nazis are pissed that blacks aren't getting violent about this injustice. They were told blacks would kill them! But just peacefully took a knee! Who's the real savage now????
Dont burn away your gear if your and dont want them just send them to me.
on board....won't "just do it" anymore!
people that are pushing the are really mad about something else. Nobody said a word when Tim Tebow took a knee
So theres a going on? Nobody cared about Nike using slave labor to make dirt cheap products to be sold for huge profits in our land but false patriotism does it?
the further supports the kneeling acts by men of color and their supporters. The flag is merely a symbol, something that shouldn't ne worshipped. The message is the important factor, just like the bus wasn't the issue...it was our position on it.
The people wanting a are missing one thing: Nike is a world-wide brand. Hell, Ronaldo has a billion dollar deal that he signed with them in 2016. It's a lifetime deal. The Nike brand isn't going to die just because you burn your stuff. THEY ALREADY HAVE YOUR MONEY!
This is a genius business move by designed to eliminate all remaining demand for the and eliminate the costs associated with maintaining the antiquated production line required to manufacture them.
do us a favor..Set your Nike hat on fire.. while youre wearing it
If you're gonna start burning your Nike products, please don't. Send them my way and I'll put them to good use for those who actually need it.
I just bought a pair of Nike court shoes from Dick's Sporting Goods.
Yall can try but wont succeed especially with the idiots who are buying Nike, just to destroy it but go off
Seeing trending because of the Colin Kaep ad is so annoying. This country needs help.
White people seem to have a strong opinion on social injustices today. I guess with all the years of white people having to deal with these injustices against them has built a really strong understanding.
Hey, Colin Kaepernick is going to be just fine thank you.Donald, you have never sacrificed anything in your lifeBelieve In Something.Even if it means sacrificing everything.   
are these the same shoes that you played in ass

Burning your Nike gear and moving to Converse, is a brilliant strategy! This will show Nike just how patriotic you are. The fact that Nike owns Converse should not deter your remarkable display of patriotism.
is working again! Just not for the N.F.L. The former quarterback is the new face of Nike's "Just Do It" campaign.
If you never want to buy another Nike product, that's up to you. But instead of burning anything with a Swoosh, give it to someone - anyone - who can use it.
I need for yall to keep this SAME ENERGY when the new Js drop too
If really cares about justice, he would address the fact that NIKE pays its workers LESS THAN A DOLLAR an hour to make the apparel he's promoting, but I bet he doesnt really give a shit.
White privilege...Blind loyalty...Stupidity...Same same. Same.
Im not giving Nike anymore business Ok Tammy, Im sure you spend a TON on athletic wear

I'd like to know how participants felt last week when the White House dishonored military veteran and American hero John McCain by raising the flag from half-staff to full-staff.
But also know that unless you stop supporting USA national teams, NFL teams and a whole hell of a lot of college teams, the isn't gonna do *any* good because in supporting those teams you are also supporting . Also, they already have your money! Good luck.
named as face of 30th anniversary ‚ÄòJust Do It campaign.
Just do it
Wow. Just wow. Idiocracy reaches a new fever pitch. Im out. No NIKE for me... middle finger NFL, Colin & Nike. Id go barefoot before Id put your sweat shop shoes on my American PROUD feet. MAGA
If you want to boycott Nike, perhaps it would serve you better to sell your Nike branded gear and use that money to buy other brands or donate to causes/campaigns that you believe in.
The irony of the is that Nike has been the outfitter of the for a while now. So the same people supporting the NFL to spite Kaep are still supporting. Nike still wins and racist idiots are funding both sides of their own argument inadvertently
if yall dont want your Nike clothes because of your racist views at least donate to those in need instead of burning or cutting them up...
Nike is smart to put Colin Kaepernick in an ad because there target audience is the hip hop crowd in the inner city poor people willing to pay 200 to 300 dollars for gym shoes so what else are they willing to waste money on.
I am pretty much sick, of ungrately POS liberal commies today. I wish aliens would cull only the stupid amongst us. That would solve 98% of our problems. Oh yeah; f* & the too!
is just another stupid boycott of today's time. -Someone that is pro-police.
It's a genius move. The demographic will lose half their net value if they burn their training shoes. Also makes it that much harder to get to the voting sites if they're barefoot.
That;s what they said during segregation too.. Why alienate the racists down South who hate black people by no longer treating blacks as 2nd class citizensU could say same in 1939Why would they support Jews when most of their customers are Nazi's
I wonder if spontaneous human combustion statistics will take an upswing. I know there have to be a few trumpkins out there decked out in Nike gear head to toe just waiting to catch on fire when they learn the news.
The slogan says it all Just Do It and thats exactly what they did
If you're doing a because of the deal with then you need to get a towel because there's racist all over your face
Ive been a fan of since my cousin showed me a pair when I was 8 years old. That was 31 years ago. I'm not going to stop now. has inspired me for years. It has its own personal meaning in my life.
BRB, just gonna go and buy a load of brand new nike gear and burn it for RTs because Im an adult virgin
White people continue to show just how stupid they are through their own racism, they claim theyre boycotting for the troops, but instead of donating their clothes to troops in need they are burning them. Proving yall dont give a fuck about the troops.
Must be pretty easy life for to sit in comfort in America and complain about "injustice" while a company that uses slave labor pays him just to use his face for marketing. Meanwhile, this guy is the one making NIKE's shoes for .50 cents an hour.
Como les gusta mamar gallo...
whether you burn or destroy your the Fact remains the same that is still the brand in the world! These dont kid yourself lol
i just bought my son a brand new pair of Nike Air Force One for 100 and something. Mf'z done lost their minds burning that shit at least tiki torches are cheaper.

. Just read quote by a marketing expert. Old angry white guys are not a core demographic for Nike. . Maybe Ill buy some Nikes for my next canvassing.
, LONG LIVE NIKE, COLIN KAEPERNICK, AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ...
Clay Travis supports Soldiers. Confederate Soldiers. You know the guys that went to war against the US Military.
If you joined the because Kaepernick is the new face of an ad campaign, but were fine when you found out slave kids are making your shoes, you are the problem.
The only reason I'm going to join is because they stopped giving out gift cards for doing the survey on receipts
Hey I need new sneakers! I usually buy NB, but I'm going with Nike this time. Thanks for having a conscience.
I'll just buy 2 pairs instead of one! I love Nike!
supporter and future face of of a feather...
How can you act like is doing a noble thing here? This company pretty much pays slave wages to the people making their product. I mean if anything it just shows is fine with slavery
A with my personal money has nothing to do about black anything. It has everything to do with them disrespecting us yet again with this idiot, unpatriotic moron of a man, black, white, brown, yellow, red makes NO difference! Im sorry if I left out a color stupid!
Buying 2 pair of Nikes today. your shoes to vets instead of burning them if you love your country
Want a good laugh? Go to the hashtag and watch these dumbasses ruin shit cause theyre big mad
It's simple to , I just can't afford their products.
Yall Qaeda needs new shoes now and they just missed all the good Labor Day Sales because they inhaled too many toxic fumes at their cute Cross(trainer) Burning.This is great economic stimulus.
Imagine thinking burning your possessions because of your wrong opinion will make a difference.
Kapernick: Donates to charities and supports communities. Chuds: Destroys stuff they already bought instead of donating to Veterans in need (because we know what this is really about).
Only Klansmen and women are participating in . Never forget who they are. Kavanaugh supporters.
Remember when NWA created ‚ÄòFuck the Police and just about everyone who wasnt okay with it just took it and walked away from it? Although now because some athlete wears pigcop sox everyone cries about it and ruin their clothes on media? Just walk away guys
A huge multi million dollar company did something I don't particularly agree with? Best burn all my shit just in case
All the people Boycotting Nike. Dont burn or cut your stuff. Give it to the homeless. Have the entire homeless population in Nike gear. Ruined the brand. And also help people at the same time. RT.
Theres def not a in my house. Im bout to go buy more for me and my kids
the day he got back...he stopped being an american. he was a war monger, and armed, the people we now know as ISIS, helped move drugs to fund wars. Watch the series "Americas War on Drugs" you just might learn something. Instead of chanting, talking points.
have no plans to burn Nike shoes or apparel. I'm refusing to buy anything else from them. That's what affects them. Future sales.
Rather than destroy your products because of their endorsement of DONATE it to organizations that can help the homeless and those in need. Its too easy to destroy something, but its just as simple to give it away.
So if you're a fan of a college team that's sponsored by Nike, are you gonna show up naked and barefoot to the stadium on Saturdays because you're butthurt? LOL Y'all have fun with that
Thanks Nike for good common sense and compassion. Ill buy More Nike now. Btw Im a 71 year old white Christian woman whose Dad, 2 husbands, a son, and 3 son in laws who served in the military. Were about as patriotic as you can get!!
Every time I see a photo of a burning shoe or a ripped up sock, it just makes me want to buy more Nike gear! No . I support and for standing up for injustice!
It's time to boycott Nike. Most of their stuff looks like clown shoes these days and worse yet they are made in sweatshops taking advantage of minorities they claim to support.
I thought white supremacists only wore orthopedic shoes or just walked barefoot on gravel. I dont understand this thats like Black ppl boycotting sky diving
's latest campaign has caused a media storm today. Within the world of marketing, do you believe all publicity is good publicity?
Must be pretty easy life for a rich athlete to sit in comfort in America and complain about "injustice" while a company that uses slave labor pays him just to use his face for marketing.
Ive never wanted to buy Nike products more than now. Good job You get all my support!!
NIKE is garbage. Why would you alienate a large group of your customers? Surely they know this is going to piss off a ton of people.
Never again. Like the Holocaust.
Why would WANT to get rid of HALF of their US customer base by promoting FAILURE Colin Krapernack? Doesn't make much business sense - stockholders take note!
It you want to do the crap, give me an articulate reason as to why & why Trump using the flag as a revenge tactic against McCain was different, we may still reciprocate following one another. If you can't, you're obviously racist and retarded like your daddy Trump.
Good morning Republicans, all those Boycotting Nike I will gladly take all your Retro Jordans, Kobes, Lebrons, Kyries, SB dunks, etc. Size 11.5-12 ...I support your boycott
I ordered two pairs of Nikes on Friday for no sociopolitical or fundamental reason at all. Ill order a couple more today in order to stand in solidarity with a company that has continually given a platform to those willing to risk it all in the name of justice.
This just makes better sense to me, than cutting up clothing you already PAID FOR DUMB ONES!
I've had family fight and die for this country. I've had family come home and never be the same. Y'all can shove your excuses up your ass. I support Kap
Love watching racists and people who are too stupid to realize the kneeling movement has nothing to do with people hating their country destroy the Nike apparel they already paid for because of , as if theyre totally getting Nike back for the ad. Keep it up!
That swoosh is profits going out the window. Ya cant get us back, ever. JS
you have no idea what America is all about!!!No one needs your brand to KNEEL! Your slap in the face to patriots will be felt in your bottom line. Nike stands with cop hating anti-American divisive washed-up ex- football player.
Of course not...I am changing religions so my kids can get excused absences for religious events...Christianity is the only one that is not excused! I just bought bye bye
Breaking News: Nike has changed their slogan 2: Just Screw It
P Rico still doesnt have electricity. Flint still doesnt have clean water. Children are going to school hungry. Youth are living on the streets. But go ahead, burn your socks because youre offended that a man felt so strongly about injustice he risked everything.
Its cool if people dont want to buy more products but burning them is petty. People could totally use your socks, shoes, shirts etc. Winter is around the corner. If you dont want to wear it, donate it instead!
Every pissed off person genuinely supporting the is irrelevant because we all know they only wear shoes that look like this
People want to show their preferences in not just their political or social beliefs, they want to associate with corporations that share their beliefs too. barely makes a dent because the amount of people who suddenly see Nike as a social justice brand is higher
Thing most people do not realize with regards to Nike is that they make a very large chunk of their money abroad. Within the US, they essentially are first movers in a world where corporations are supposed to now either pick a side or lose out.
It warms my hard to see the people promoting the who were calling people hateful bigots last week because they were going to
Fuck Nike and fuck that Asshole theyre paying. My family and I wont buy another item of Nikes until they remove that dickwad. Tons of friends and coworkers have said the same
Nikes new campaign has stirred up the US publicity. What's the about?
Fox Sports Clay Travis OBLITERATES For Using Colin Kaepernick As Face Of New Campaign
Nike has decided that perpetuating a dangerous environment for law enforcement is nobel. Our home is full of multi-sport kids & adults who have always bought .Enjoy your "Street-cred" Nike, we will be spending our $ elsewhere.
MAGA supporters doing a but they wearing Walmart work boots and Jesus sandals.
Why doesn't put one of their child labour on the promotion poster ?they can also take the opportunity to show the kid playing football in his 10 mins Lunch break$NKE
I stand with . Time for some fresh kicks, anyway. I wonder where stand on this issue? They must be conflicted. I still love 'em, though. :-)
F*ck Nike - Colin K ONLY took a knee as a publicity stunt cause he was about to get by the 49ers cause he was a back up at best. He NEVER did anything to help the cause until he was about to get cut - Colin is a FAKE & that Nike would glorify it hello other brands
My husband offered to buy me new shoes IF I would burn my Nikes. Score! I was gonna burn them anyway, now I get new shoes too!
La pe√±a est√° boicoteando a Nike , o ni eso xq comprar compran luego lo quemanPor las condiciones de trabajo en los pa√≠ses donde hacen la ropa? por la explotaci√≥n? noXq hicieron un anuncio con un deportista que denunci√≥ brutalidad policial en USA, aplauso pls
This guy cheated! He's supposed to put on an ENTIRE OUTFIT of Nike clothes and shoes, douse himself with gasoline and light the flame!
Why tell Us You want to burn Your Nike, when You can ‚ÄìJust Do It.Anyway, that's isn't My problem. I hope this racist argument stops some day, when We all defeat the inferiority in Us.Racism is nothing close to superiority, it's gross inferiority.
We should all be as committed as Phil is to the . In fact, what's the point of this boycott unless we all burn our shoes while wearing them. Make a point to show we mean business!
Put on my shoes to show support for them naming as their spokesman. I had forgotten how comfortble they are. Need to go buy a couple more pairs today. Definitely NOT supporting the
Just got stopped and asked why I was wearing Nikes. I thought they meant that I should get new shoes because they're beat to hell, but they got into the bsListen, even if I agreed with you, Nike already has my money. If I burned the shoes, I'd be broke AND barefoot
You would have had the support of the entire country...
My husband offered to buy me new shoes IF I would burn my Nikes. Score! I was gonna burn them anyway, now I get new shoes too!
FOR THOSE OF YOU PARTICIPATING IN THE Listen, this is your chance to turn this into the LARGEST charitable event in our history! So, if you wanna boycott Nike just donate your stuff to those...
Now here is an idea! But this would be logical & common sense sometimes isnt so common. Boycotting Nike is just a smoke screen to deflect from the real issue.
Do some damn good ... you unfocused excuses for civilization
sorry you lost another customer over this pos video coming soon of me burning my 20 some pair of nike shoes and countless clothes . i know you dont care but u will when the U.S people stand together
Proudly sporting one of my pairs of shoes today in support of their decision and to jab a finger in the eye of the idiocy that is the .
Young black kids get killed in the ghettos for these stupid NIKE shoes. For overpriced leather, cloth and plastic. And Nike decides to promote a cop hater, Colin Kaepernick, as their spokesperson. He hates on same cops that help the kid shot for the stupid NIKE shoes.
Burning your Nikes, is effectively giving money for a product youre no longer using. Which almost, in theory, drives the market value of Nike as a company.
JUST DONT BUY IT!Its ur $$$$$$ is a zero, not a hero.
Theyre burning shoes because they know they cant burn crosses anymore. No doubt they have that same malice when they burn their lil BOGO outlet socks.
Hey, morons, it's NOT a when you burn your own stuff because you've already PAID for it.
Nike renewed his contract with for eight more years and some users have burned their tennis..
instead of burning/cutting up your Nike products, just send them to me please.
Fox Sports Clay Travis OBLITERATES For Using Colin Kaepernick As Face Of New Campaign
I am very disappointed in Nike for choosing such an unworthy face to represent their brand. Please honor talented athletes not people with political agendas that divide us.
is happening for all the wrong reasons but it shows that conservatives have more willpower than anyone else. Liberals stay talking abt how nike abuses children and has inhumane working conditions but they wont boycott nike for that
The Australian sheep and lamb industry will slaughter more than 30 million animals this year, but an additional 10 to 15 million lambs will die -- shivering and hungry -- in icy fields.
10 year plus LARGE shareholder and owner of lots of gear, selling all my stock today and never buying any Nike products ever again. How dumb can management be, not what I would expect from what has historically been a well managed company
yall lames have nothing else better to do w/ your time but burn Nike gear cause someone wants to express their opinions. FUCK THE !!
I'd cut all the swooshes off all my clothes if I ever wore that bullshit in the first place. I don't, though, 'cause I ain't a teenage girl.
If you're questioning your IQ today, be rest assured that there are some people out there that went out to buy some Nike stuff just so they can get home, burn it & hashtag on twitter
No one in Syria would give a flying f*ck about who was standing or kneeling during whatever. US is a big, dumb, fat, country that needs to LOOK FOR things to fight over.
Seriously?! Why burn up or destroy clothing you already own? Nike already has your money for that! Makes no sense. The homeless or homeless Veterans can use the clothes. Give it away!
Sooo is trending because of Trump Suppoters? Okay I was confuse on whats going on
I need a new pair of shoes and I will be buying just because of this.. is this how we
How about it , you just signed on to be the face of a company that uses slave labor and say you are standing up for injustice?
I see these videos of people destroying their nike stuff and its honestly confusing why they would rather burn them over giving them to a charity or to people who need them. If youre going to boycott Nike, at least give your stuff to those who need it
Haven't bought Nike in years. Make something in America and maybe I will. I still support colin though.
100 kids just walked out mid-shift at the Nike sweatshop in China to own the libs.
WORLDWIDE TRENDS:1. Kavanaugh2. . Grassley4. . ™Ÿä_ÿ™ÿ™ÿÆÿ±ÿ¨6. . . Blumenthal9. "Merrick Garland"10. "Gustavo Cerati"
Taking this knowledge into account. It seems like Nike is taking the pain of the black community and capitalizing on it. As people want to support the Kaepernick's message, they will run into the consideration of purchasing his Nike product line.
Merely a thought: I wonder if those hacking up Nike products or those angry will turnaround and use that money they might have spent on a good cause. Cutting up swooshes or demonstrating anger doesn't particularly help anyone or better the world.
The support for by ACTUAL vets is outstanding! Forget the the REAL patriots are here..~>
Destroying your shoes because you're angry that a black man stood up to racial oppression, you are part of the problem.
Sacrificing half your customer base like me - Ill never buy again. And I have kids.
Those who support are basically the same people who tried to boycott Star Wars.
Me: So youre mad at Nike.Trumpster: Hell yes, Im boycotting by burning my Nikes?Me: Where did you get the Nikes?Trumpster: I just bought them.Me: Thats not how a boy....oh fuck it never mind, burn away.
Had to RT because this tweet is so hahaha
How about it , what do you have to say about this injustice? You REALLY want your message co-opted by a billion dollar company that uses slave labor?
Don't boycott Nike because of Colin Kaepernick, boycott them because they are overpriced. I'm spending a fortune on them just to keep my nephew happy, he's a shoe guy.
All you to make a are doing so because it is in your , like // so instead of , the that gave to you and your .
This generations icon for resistance has just received a blank check to pursue his cause. What are your thoughts about this historic partnership? Will you
I didnt rock nikes anyway esp JOrdans;I literally havent bought a pair since 88.....but I may get me a pair of AF1s (discountd of course) or maybe one of these fools will just send em instead of burning em
Hate spewing feels the same ways about as does. Ill let your marinate on that for a minute.
Whats up with the ?Instead of burning your overprized , you could just stop wearing and/ or them.You already paid for that stuff anyway, so it doesnt affect at all.
This is NOT a race issue. It is:Country vs. NikePOC $ count big time. Thousands of POCs have gotten off of (and are FAST getting off of) the Lefty Dem Plantation, and their MENTAL PRISONS!! Just wait & watch!!
Is it just me or is all the burning causing a fire in anyone elses loins for Colin Kaepernick?
I know many who support the flag over Nike and the NFL. This will cost
is laughable. Burning trainers just makes you the fool with burnt rubber on your lawn and nothing on your feet. Buy Nike
How is Kaepernick kneeling STILL a topic of conversation? I just saw the thread... For why though, y'all?! Geeze.
We aint boycotting shit over here lol Ima go buy mad shirts cause theyre cute and comfy
By ty he looks of his body and posture, he looks like he is not using the sport equipment and athletic wear his straight dad bought for him. This is the same Republican that hates Gays, but loves Gay Porn.
If you are not going to boycott Nike over the Collin Kap slap in the face, then boycott them for their abuse of workers including children. Never buying Nike Products again.
Colin Kaepernick becomes the face of Nike's Just Do It campaign
Just means that only the best will be wearing from now on, yesssss
Boycotting a global company is pointless. Sit back and watch Nike divide ppl until there are no more to divide. Save your energy and enjoy the show. BTW, I havent bought Nike since 1989.
Ironically, many supporters and those calling for a , aren't actually users of performance sports ware by the look of things
Just to follow up....
If you're burning your gear instead of giving it to homeless , giving to a vet. shelter or spending that time volunteering at a hospital, you've proven that it was never about the troops/vets/patriotism. Just nationalistic racism.
America, show us how racist and intolerable you are today.
Heres my take, and I think enough time has passed. I'm all for taking a political stance... however, Collin did it in a way that distracted from the real issues. Talk became about the NFLs policies and not about racial injustice.
I've not been a particular fan of Nike products. But I will buy more now in support of Colin Kaepernick and the principle of 'equal treatment under the law.'
they don't care about a racist ---destroying Nike apparel they've already made a profit on is hilarious...Nike sales will soar and you are just big mad without a few Nike items WOW
Damn I hate that I gonna have to shop for workout clothes cause theres fixing to be a burning of my Nike stuff! $$
With being an entrepreneur, a lot of my time has been spent researching why consumers buy products. A common reason is though emotions. People make purchases to help alleviate emotional burdens of anger and frustration towards situations.
Folks out here really burning up they Nike gear because of the New Kapernick and Serena ad.. folks really openly racist out here.
So, did really just trash theirselves by putting that clown Kapernick as the face?
Lets not forget, the people behind are the same people who broke their Keurigs after the company had pulled their ads off of Hannity. Sounds to me like conservatives just like wasting money. Whos the idiot now?
When Nike says they are promoting 's movement for social justice, yet consistently use overseas slave labor to make the shoes they sell for hundreds of dollars, you can see they dont give a shit about him or his message.
This is PFC Matthew Bean. He believed in our country and sacrificed everything for her.

Good grief! Im almost certain black people are & always have been the biggest consumer for Nike products. All that athletic clothing everyone from kids to rappers to athletes wear. Now they are supporting . It will only boost sales here & abroad.
Stupid, divisive decision you made there. Hows that 3% drop in your stock price? You suck
The is so serious that its trending number 1 still on Beyonc√©s birthday... Beyonc√©s birthday.
I mean we stopped watching the . I think we'll be just fine without .
Horrible , horrible business decision by $NKE
But forreal, if any of you dumb idiots is getting geared up to burn your Nike gear, make sure you just donate it. Give it to somebody that will appreciate it.
I'm buying my 1st pair of Nike in 12yrs because of the ad, No
Umm I keep hearing about how old white guys not buying isnt going to do anything. Let me remind you that old white guys own the stock....not the kids who shoot each other over
Horrible , horrible business decision by $NKE
This in my opinion makes no sense. People look ridiculous destroying their own property in hopes to send a company a message that already has your money. Listen to Kori people, a more productive solution if you still want to get rid of ur stuff.
Trump supporters talking about how they respect law enforcement while they attack the & daily.
News flash: Adidas would have worked with if he got to sign to an NFL team, which we all know hes being black balled by them. Adidas fully support him. So do your research before you try to be clever.
just get obama to market your products
Sound to me like you just chose a side,
For decades, has been using child labor in sweatshops to make subpar products to sell you at outrageous prices, but now they gave a contract to a footballer you don't like, so yes, NOW it's time to boycott them.
crazy how people are made at Colin for but support and his crusade against the FBI, DOJ and our democracy. These same people support Trumps support of Putin/Russia meddling in our election....a slap in the face of patriotism and the
meet this Retired Navy Chief. I served so that Kap can have his voice and speak on the INJUSTICE system.
watching go down with Just don't buy Instead of burning clothes, give them to poor people and those in need. will be the official sponsor of the those who are struggling and need help, including
Just dont do it! I may not be a consumer anymore. Such a shame
Stop using the troops as an excuse to burn your Nike shit. Im not your scapegoat. Im gonna sit over here and continue to buy my Nike stuff, they give military a discount!
instead of burning your clothes it would be great if you decide to donate them to the less fortunate. Just a thought.... There are plenty of homeless veterans who could probably use a Nike jogger this winter..
The funniest thing is the same people who want to boycott Nike because of a picture were flipping their shit last week when the other side wanted to boycott in-n-out for making a donation to republicans, calling them whiny and shit.
Just Do It Nike.
Racist white America cant stand to see a black man fighting racial injustice on an ad but they are completely comfortable seeing another black man murdered by corrupt law enforcement? Disgusting.
If you're tired of the disrespect and hatred these players and businesses show for our flag and our country then stop buying their products and going to their games. Quit being hypocrites. Show you love your country more than a pair of sneakers.MAGA!
Everyone is all about this talking about Reebok here we come. But..I guess Im cheap because I dont have Nike shoes except sliders that went on sale for $10..and cheer shoes since high school
All of this is for nothing unless there is productive conversation. Quit the name calling. Quit the extreme actions. Start listening and trying to understand. Both sides. This is ridiculous.
Think or so what you want. We support those who pave the way for others, stand up for what they believe in, and dont care what others think about it. There will be no here.
Keep burning your shoes fools, it's hilarious watching ya'll torch money you've already spent.
Majerhat Bridge Collapse ,Causes Traffic Problems, Train Services Hit
No Nike for me. I support the police !
Yall burning your Nikes like there arent people in need you could just donate them to Yall just doing it for attention and its sad
I guess if a bunch of racist morons are trying to start a I'll just have to buy even more.
Notice how the same folks who like to falsely invoke veterans with are the same ones backing a president who insulted a POW named John McCain and a slain Muslim soldier who also served.Where was the outrage then?Just admit you're racist and don't like Kaepernick.
the amount of times i have said ‚Äògod yall are stUpider than i thought these past two years is astounding. NO here.proud supporter of and always will be.
If you are doing the hmu Im looking for a pair of Size 12 shoes to wear to work. Ill donate the rest to the shelter here. Just a lower class citizen looking to help your cause lol.
All the folks burning Nike products and attacking for "disrespecting the flag" are probably the same bozos that get dressed up like this....
I won't buy another pair of your shoes, because of your association with Colin Kaepernick. You're clearly doing this as a political move, which makes no sense. Fire whomever came up with this poor business move. It's going to hurt your stock and your brand
Just Do It.
't worry about the boycott Nike. Most of us who really care, are spending our money on work boots anyway.
For the people who are doing the because of the Colin Kaepernick endorsement, Ill gladly take those Nikes and Jordans off your hands. Size 10‚Äì11 in shoes, and size Medium in tops and bottoms.
In all fairness, the assholes burning their Nikes are simultaneously helping to destroy the environment so really theyre making two idiotic statements all at once, and thats what they consider accomplishment
It is your duty as an American to boycott anti American companies who support islamic terrorism.
If you are able to cut up, set on fire or just throw into the trash your gear because they have Kaepernick in an ad, you have too much time, money and white privilege on your hands!
The 10/90 Christians are out in full force to out-indignant each other bc a man is being rewarded for standing for American ideals. know the 10/90s. 10% of their tweets are about how godly they claim to be & the other 90% about all the "other" people they hate
Now if we can just get them to boycott food and water, our problems will be solved.
Im retweeting this again, because its an incredible answer by on why & the movement he started makes a true American. Watch BEFORE burning those s, please.
Hate to say it, but Nike is about to start their own professional leagues, & make everyone else lose a lot of money, because everyone is showing their lack of love for Black people. This will be interesting. 85% of the NFL & NBA, are black.
Nike has committed ! "You've got to stand for something or you'll FALL for anything". I won't support terrorism!
An act of desperation by an out of style, overpriced brand. Stopped using the products long ago so have nothing to burn.
said Nike was horrible for abusing child labor overseas and no one cared. Well, if Nike is abusing poor underprivileged kids like this, why would a "hero" like be selling shoes for them??? Hmm, weird.
They dont need help. Trump supporters humiliate themselves and this country daily. So keep boycotting things you never bought from vendors you never frequented.Im gonna buy some Nikes after I go to Starbucks. Then I going to buy some books from Amazon.
Dear : you decided to run an ad that would cause millions to literally hate your company. Good luck with that. .
Nike just lost ALL our business - forever. Just do it America - Reject Nike as they have rejected America.
See where these anti-Nike people draw the line? Apparently, it was okay for Nike to use Michael Vick to sell products, but Colin Kaepernick? Nope, sorry. Dog fighting? We're fine with that. Racial equality? ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!
names were Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams SAY THEIR NAMES!
the people that are big mad are the same people that fuck their daughters, let their son get touched by the priest, sleep with socks on, put milk in before cereal, and drive tractors on the road.
Waking up deciding what to wear today Nike windshield jacket Nike USA soccer jersey Nike training boxer briefs Nike running Swift pants Nike no show socks Nike vapormax
, Ill put my stuff in the trash. UA all the way. There, I just did it!
If this causes MAGA to burn their already-purchased gear, lets hope goes into real estate!
This dude hates America and yet dumb ppl support him .Me Id deport him
Boycott Nike? But yall support a man who a WAR HERO a coward because he was caught. But said his foot hurt so he couldnt fight in Vietnam
Please send me all of the XXL Nike gear that you dont want, with the exception of compression shorts/pants/underwear...I have plenty of Tide Pods to use on them..
'Well Done, Colin'  John Brennan Gushes Over Colin Kaepernick's Nike Campaign. Commies sticking together.
To all the people replacing CK with a soldier, Nike isnt going to put a soldier, because they dont have political stances and make shit for the NFL. A company like under armor however is clearly a republican company and they make military gear. Common sense
People be burning, cutting they shoes with this and i just bought 4 pairs for the family and was trying to get a discount code lol
If you are one of these fools going around burning Kap shirts and shoes. Then you obviously still dont understand why he was kneeling. And I feel sorry for how stupid you are.
I LOVE my NIKE Football Shark Cleats! I use them every day for cycling and running the dogs on grass. Even prouder now . I'd buy more and I won't join the .
No respect for or the Fans. Time for a new brand. Just Do It!
Let's call a spade a spade.If you support the you are a . because you accept all the lies that spews. because you cannot accept a black man's .
The just goes to show that people want to be mad about something, even without understanding what theyre supposed to be mad about.
This just in....White ppl burning Newport cigarettes bc of upside-down check ...the disrespect
Boycott Nike - Read here: brand new 'Just Do It' campaign, which features NFL player Colin Kaepernick, has not gone down well with customers.
People really boycotting Nike because of Kap??? Y'all lame for that!!!
Just so you know he died by an accident that happened in Afghanistan aka friendly fire. I am prior military too and Ive fought for your colonizing racist ass country.
On my way to the stores to buy ALL the Nikes. is fucking hilarious...Trumptards are dumb as fuck.
To all the idiots burning their Nike apparel...you do realize that youve already paid for the merchandise and therefore, Nike already has your money, yes? If you dont want to support a patriot like , at least donate your apparel, dont waste it.
Apparently, John Pavlovitz hates those who sacrifice for all of us.
Dear MAGA supporters .. Nike has survived worse than you .. You are petty, you are small && you are outnumbered on all sides
. Whats crazy is that is fighting for and all around love for !!!! We all know . Were living in Messed up times they want us all separated so that we can go to war with each other !
Instead of burning your clothing/shoes, just donate them.
I might go cop some new running shoes just to spite
And do these "patriotic Americans" burning shoes as part of a realize that sponsors USA basketball, soccer and track and field (among others) national teams - that's the US national teams - so are these loyal Americans not gonna root for the US anymore?
"Nike slides after tapping Colin Kaepernick as the new face of its 'Just Do It' ads (NKE)"
being poor forced me to boycott Nike before it was cool, plus every pair of Nikes I've ever had fell apart
Or even burning these items.. lets be logical since all of your pretend outrage is over the military.. you know the same ones that you pretend that this no standing for the flag is disrespecting .
Just contacted the company who handles my investments and retirement. Directed them to sell my Nike Stock
Outstanding business decision the absolute dolt that came up with this idea should be walked out of the building immediately!!! hemorrhage...
Guess you couldnt have donated those shoes to people in need though? Look, if you take part in the thats your prerogative. But why destroy perfectly good things that others could use?
I support everyone that dnt support him n the movement
want to do my part in boycottin . I promise I might burn any nike products sent to me or my family. Must be in original packaging. Gift receipt is fine. DM me for preferred sizes and colors.
I dont mind that is using his platform to voice his opinion. But is he doing it for the money as well cuz he couldnt hack it in the NFL?
I dare say people calling for a because the company signed Colin Kaepernick had and have no qualms about buying company products when the issue is sweatshop conditions in foreign manufacture of its products.
The most hilarious thing about is that the NFL is contracted with Nike for the next 8 years. Are y'all really not gonna buy your fave team jerseys? Cause of a Colin Kaepernick endorsement? Y'all are fake mad while Nike and the NFL still make their money
anyone that is getting rid of s for the just hmu. im a 5.5 in mens and a 7 in womens !!!!
Nike played a long-game PR stunt, using as bait to bring all of the attention he garnered from to their brand.NFL ratings have tanked. Kap wears hate-inciting socks depicting police officers as pigs.Nike's PR team should be fired.
Thousands of homeless vets y'all claim to care so much about and you're out here burning socks and shoes because you got triggered instead of donating them to those vets? Y'all don't give a shit about veterans, you're mad because told you to be.
Heard heaps of Americans are boycotting and throwing out their gear over some shit I have no idea about motherfuckers better send that shit over to me cause Ill rock that gear
Is anyone even doing the ? Every tweet Ive seen about it is just making fun of it
People are burning their products after the company took on . Now, where have we seen racists burning symbols before? I don't think that's what "Just Do It" means. Lol
I like how half the people using the tag are trying to justify burning their 40 year old Nike shoes while the other half is making fun of those people
Just change brands and sit back ..And Watch Them Lose Money
because of Kaepernick JUST DO IT
Just to show I troll both sides I am going to buy a pair of Nike's
Disrespecting those who have sacrificed for all of us doesn't matter? It's more important to push a conspiracy theory by disrespecting our veterans?
"Just don't do it"!
Let's see, we have gun violence, a drug epidemic, skyrocketing healthcare prices, an aging infrastructure, numerous oversea threats, etc, but lets talk about a shoe ad instead. "United we stand, divided we fall."
lol US problems
Just when I thought I couldnt love anymore, they prove me wrong....
Viendo como se desploman las acciones de Nike por apoyar zurdos, jodanse primero la publicidad de la inclusi√≥n de las mujeres y ahora por apoyar un antipatria.
Nike doesnt just sell in America so....have fun burning things you already paid for !!
Just do it. Stocks are down
So theres people really out here attempting to boycott Nike?!?! Thats like trying to boycott peanut butter from a PB&J sandwich... its just not going to happen
I never bought Nike products because sweatshops now Ill never buy them cuz
Once you've Googled who is, marvel at the fact they have any sound at all with this genius as an employee. He's still wearing socks, and he's burnt something he paid for.
Two things about the . One - you now have no shoes but they still have your money. Two, if you are destroying your clothes, make sure you're not one of those people who say liberals are easily offended or a person who uses words like "triggered" and "snowflake".
Nike just really hurt themselves financially!
Just Do It.
Businesses should stay out of politics. The minute a business takes a political stance, they alienate half their customers automatically. So my question is, who is the out of touch marketing genius who came up with this idiotic idea?
Does Nike still use sweat shops?
It may interest people to know that Warren Buffet bought BROOKS RUNNING SHOES (the company, not just a single pair) back in 2016. Warren loves them. I wear them because I have flat feet. They're awesome.
You know when you support - you're not going anywhere in life - who needs shoes?
Only in AMERICA will people burn Nike gear over someone wanting to make a difference while its people in the other neighborhoods in AMERICA that wish they had at lest 1 good pair just to walk in Im not even getting into other countries around the world
Anyone participating in a is proving exactly why was kneeling in the first place: because too many white people value their songs and flags and privilege,
To all of the conservatives who are burning Nike gear: I challenge you to donate it to the many homeless veterans who you think youre defending/supporting.
If 25% of white people are racist and 25% are not, here's another indicator why the 50% assuming is intensely dangerous
If you guys are gonna burn your Nikes there are shelters and other places you can donate them. Your money has already supported the company so not spending more is one thing, but trashing something that could help someone else just seems more ego than logic.
I just have this picture of uber patriot in stadium stall having emergency shit during the anthem and forcing himself to stand and soiling the entire stall and his clothing in a putric mess.
I hope from all of this changes in community's/ society occurs but i fear the statement "Still I see no changes" will occur
I hardly ever buy anything Nike, but now I will. The is forcing me to shop. I will Just Do It! Thank you,
please donate your Nike apparel and shoes to your local Salvation Army Centers... homeless could use them!
Nike signe la plus forte baisse du Dow Jones pour avoir choisi de placer 3 sportifs en clash avec Trump au c≈ìur de sa nouvelle campagne. Les pro-Trump se d√©cha√Ænent avec
supports athletes who cant get jobs because they suck at the game. Whites arent supreme; but is a loser. If he spent more time training instead of complaining, hed be happy and employed.
- Enough said. If you cannot stand for the US Flag or the National Anthem I have nothing to do with you.
They will always find a way to emphasize the racial divide that festers within "America the beautiful" smh
Hey, seriously, if anyone out there plans on burning their size 10 1/2 Kyrie 4s, how about you donate them to this veteran instead? Show me how much you really support the troops.
While I don't agree with your reasoning, if you truly must be rid of your Nike apparel, please donate it (clean/good cond.). There are thousands who can't afford nice, warm shoes, etc.
FACT: Since stress is the root of many health problems, the relaxing effect of jazz music can have incredible healing influence. It physically changes your body by lowering your heart and respiratory rate.
I just returned almost $400 in firs day of school shoes for my kids. Not gonna have it. Just glad they pulled this nonsense in my 30 day window to return.
Nike is 90 billion'ish dollar company and sells all over the world, not just to racist white americans. If you trash their product, it means they already got your money. Being hated by racists is really good for their brand image so go ahead and
We will not and are not going to donate anything to anyone. We wpmork for our things. Thank sincerely ALL Trump supporters.
i see a lot of people cutting up socks and shorts and burning shoes, but the real tea sis is if they are cutting up/burning their favorite sports team apparel because it's most likely Nike
wont be getting another dime from my family! Hope that chump youre supporting is worth the lost revenue.
has made almost all their products using modern slavery methods in overseas sweatshops for decades, but their support of Colin Kaepernick leads to unbridled outrage? Got it.
Hey all you sheeple - dont forget that relaxed air pollution restrictions just so you could burn your plastic shoes in peace. Smart!
Wow look at all the racists! Thank yawl for starting this hashtag because now I know who to block on Twitter.
The lost hundreds of millions of $ because of Colin Kaepernick. Nikes stock today fell by over $3 a share shaving over $4.5 billion off the companys market cap.
Lol these racists really think they're creating pressure by boycotting Nike and burning their trainers. Do they realise black people are still the biggest consumers? I'm just putting that out there.
Its true, Dave. I ate your lesson, but you were wrong. In a fluctuating market, the average cost per share of a stock will be lower than the average price per share of a portfolio for the same time period. I couldnt let your turn in that shit.
For every cray cray person who is participating in the and burning their $325 Nike sneakers, remember: Nike has the exclusive contract to supply the NFL with game day uniforms & apparel until 2028. Your move, Sparky!
Rofl! Nike owners are burning their shoes b/c the company showed its support for Kapernick. Lol! If you dont like what theyre doing, stop buying their products, dont go on a shoe burn tirade.
Just bought my first Nike shirt!
NIKE BOYCOTT: Shoes and clothes are being destroyed on social media after was named the face of Nike's "Just Do It" campaign.
Dear Hate has taken you and blinded you to what is going on. You have become a trained monkey. You are being LIED to, and USED-to help our enemies take America down. Wake up. Become human again, and re-learn how to think for yourself.
Muted market reaction to Nike's introduction of Colin Kaepernick as face of 'Just Do It' ad campaign. Shares off about 2% to $80.50, but still hovering near 2018 highs; company's value up more than 20% this year
I just updated this with my comments on the controversy.
because I always prefer Adidas.
For all the girlies & gents destroying their merchandise. Just hand it the fuck over sis. Yall out here burning new shoes, pants etc!
Kaepernick desrespeitando o hino e a Bandeira americana, imbecis querendo destruir os Estados Unidos tamb√©m. Cuspindo covardemente no prato que comem.
. maybe you and your sound guy should focus your celebrity and energy somewhere else.
PSA: If you're mad about Nike's new Kaepernick ad enough to try burning your shoes/clothes, instead DONATE THEM. Someone in need can likely use it & may not have the luxury of caring what sort of ad campaign the company is currently running.
If you're planning on burning your clothing and shoes how about you donate them to vets first. Just a thought.
Imagine boycotting something because a man kneeled down.
I'm curious, would supporters of also boycott & phones if they offered a for charity?
This move by Nike will prove to be the worst marketing decision since zero calorie Coke. Another company entering politics! Nike will find that unsupporting an unamerican Kaepernick may well destroy their company. Lets all help Nike jump into their dumster!!!
In my house wasting food was a big no no. Burning my clothes was the same deal. I get people are pissed. I do. But can we just have one godforsaken day where we all just get along?
Colin Kaepernick () has never disrespected veterans. Those who believe he has are just showing their ignorance. He is about social change and equality. If you take part in the , you are standing against everything America should stand for.
since we stand for our flag and know only .000001% of cops are racist, doesnt make us racist. liberals are actually creating the divide. nikes, your stock will plummet for good reason now
Trump supporters realizing that was the only pair of shoes they owned. ..
Instead of burning your clothes and shoes for this just give em to me, I need more stuff to workout in.
So I'm from Europe, so i don't Understand all of this, but why is all of Twitter loosing their Shit because of shoes? Is that a normal thing in the US?? Someone tell me please.
Dear ,This is one of the many reasons why I do not support and why I wont be buying shoes or other products anymore. Ive been wearing Nike since I was a kid in the early 80s and now Im done.
Honestly shouldve happened YEARS ago. But it shouldve been because of their sweatshops, child labor, etc...
Americans have their priorities all over the place. Any Americans reading, your country has become the laughing stock of the world. You have a egomaniac supremacist as a president and his supporters burning their Nike shit that they've already bought? LMAO!
If only this was the same outrage as the , then Flint wouldve had clean water by now & many people would have been able to afford healthcare & food today. Focus the energy you put in this behind an issue that really matters.
What Happens When Aaron Rodgers Just... Disappears? sr22,,
Puma endorses Jay-Z, who declined to perform at this years Super Bowl because he supported Kaepernick. Adidas endorses multiple rappers and athletes who have thrown their support to Kaepernick.
I think Nike's next "Just Do It" campaign should be Tim Tebow.Then all these idiots burning/destroying their own shit will have to go buy new stuff. , ya'll need a marketing guy? I've got ideas, fam.
The people who post military memes about the real heroes are the same people who hang yellow ribbons and thank soldiers in military fatigues for their service. But donating actual money or time to vets? Doubt it.
any Nike products because apparently when the happens there will only be limited supplies so we must all share
I stopped buying Nike stuff a year ago anyway because is just better quality
If anyone has a "like new" pair of Nike that you just can't stand to have now because you are delusional, I'll take them!
sounds extremely racist I'm not even much of a tennis shoe person but now I am gonna buy up me some gear to support Nike because of their support for Colin which is a support for me and my people . .
I dont really care for the boycott. Just here for the laughs.
I love how all the posts are people pointing out how stupid it is on every level.But let's be fair the type of person who would be boycotting Nike isn't exactly the kind of person who are capable of reaching logical conclusions after elementary gatherings of info.
Ive bought 3 pairs of Nikes this month enjoy your Skechers cause Im not going to
Dont waste perfectly good shoes. will donate them to people in need all over the world. Send shoes to:Kickn It For A Cause 7538 stage road, concord va 24538
Why dont republicans donate clothes instead of burning/cutting them on camera because they are offended? People in third world countries would love to have those clothes. Such a disgrace.
Just do it! !
I mean, fuck Nike for their slave labor & sweatshops, but at least all the dumbshit conservatives are destroying their $100 shoes that they already paid for. Plus, Kaepernick deserves the support.
I just can't wait for them to be delivered. Will actually be visiting a brick and mortar store for my purchase TODAY!
Nike wants to support a person who opposes the flag? Geesh thank God I'm that person who doesn't wear or buy Nike products.
if youre participating in the youre probably a racist, ignorant and stupid. period. yall are reaching trying to make this about the armed forces when the real reasoning has constantly been explained. its just sad at this point. do better
The should be boycotted for not paying taxes in the USA and funneling the to accounts.
Why dont you use the picture of wearing his Castro shirt as part of your ad!
However, instead of destroying the clothes or shoes, you should donate them to a homeless shelter that houses countless veterans. Im sure they dont care about that logo on the apparel and will be happy to have these donated items.
We did & I got some really nice new fishing equipment from . Along with a Yeti cup to keep my coffee warm while I fish in my hoodie. Brought along my Across the Bridge by . The Resistance just keeps making my shopping more fun.
I get being mad at Nike because they paid Kaepernick to dis the country's armed services, what I don't get is why anyone would admit to buying Nike knowing they operated sweatshops abroad???
The should be boycotted for not paying taxes in the USA and funneling the to accounts.
White Privilege...Kneeling players of color: "It's about police brutality and racial injustice."Donald Trump: "It's about disrespecting the Military, the flag, and America."You: "It's about whatever Donald Trump says it's about."
Trump won. We get results. As far as I know this is day one of the . Lets see what their tune is after a few months of 60 Million less customers.
These dumbass white supremacist, Blacks 4 Trump, and supporters are become unhinged and burned their sneakers because they stupid and straight up delusional. They can say all they want to all day. I don't give a shit.
The should be boycotted for not paying taxes in the USA and funneling the to accounts.
No Games Just Sports
Nike:With your decision to enlist Colin Kaepernick as your spokesperson, you have completely isolated your conservative customer base.And do you really think these guys buy athletic shoes?Best of luck.
Also, Nike owns Converse, so if you want to burn your stuff from either of those brands, just throw them at me and Ill take them.
The should be boycotted for not paying taxes in the USA and funneling the to accounts.
Sooo yall really pressed about Nike, yall burning your Nike shoes and socks... Yall just wait until Idris Elba becomes James Bond, I wanna see what yall burn then..
They used to call me toilet back in college cuz everyone shitted on my face
Ha! Joke's on you , I prefer because of their affordability and comfort. But if I did own your shoe brand, I am now forced to burn them in a safe and professional manner because of a boring marketing campaign.
Yep!!! Hey Nike, how about using a real hero? Someone who served our country not some overpaid useless athlete! Adidas here I come!
These people boycotting by burning their products or ruining them is hilarious. Like yeah bitch, burn that expansive AF product you spent your own money-on that literally does not affect that companies $$.
NIKE AIR MAX PLUS $160.00
Ok fine if you dont want your stuff anymore get rid of it but give that shit to charity dont just burn perfectly good clothes & shoes
So grateful for the painfully predictable & short sighted obtuse response to on the : s'a welcome break from back to school photos. I get it...your kid is in Grade 3. There was a time where parental pride was limited to bumper stickers.
Supportters Trump boycott for idiots
Same. Kaepernick did *nothing* that insults veterans, but using veterans as a smokescreen for your shitty racism is incredibly insulting.
all a joke! the men and women in blue r the first ppl called when trouble starts.They r kicked around for attention, we should feel sorry for CK he along with the stupids at Nike r misguided.If we take the Blue away then the purge would begin!Then what? Get serious
there are some serious hot takes on this hashtag. dare i say spicy even.
...because their gear is too expensive
Nike stock starting to go down. Bad business deal with no Talent Kaepernick!
The fact that more people are ready to for the kapernick ad instead of the sweat shops shows me everything i need to know about you people. i use the term "people" loosely.
I refuse to argue with people who are participating in the know the real reason Kaepernick started to kneel but they rather avoid the real issues and make it about disrespecting the flag and vets while they wear flag swimwear and avoid homeless vets
Just for clarity: its OK to participate in the BUT not OK to stand against and ?? America
In light of this trending upon waking up this morning. I will wear all the Nike gear I own and donate what doesn't fit to make up for those destroying their items. I have a strict "No shoes worn in the house" rule, it will be broken today
The funny part about this is most of the people using the hashtag are people defending and
This reminds me both sides forget exactly what this is really about. Take a knee covers a very political directed issue that Kaepernick bit off on after enough people had it with MSM politics, after the Michael Brown riots & other support violent offenders events
Let's just say it...99% of the people posting to wear New Balance Velcro sneakers. No? You prefer Dr. Scholl's slip-ons? Either way, 's bottom line is safe. And Nike, stop exploiting workers, while you're at it...K? K!
Number of people shot to death by the police in the United States in 2017-2018. According to the numbers White Males are the people FAR MORE likely than any other demographic to be shot and killed by Police.
Aint no boycott lmao the ppl who actually buy Nike brand are just going to buy more tbh if youre cutting burning or doing anything to your Nike apparel thank you for showing that you are a racist trump fuck boy
I recognize others. I support .
called this picture gross and disturbing this morning on Those words exemplify everything wrong with and their and the infamous ratings plunge
Hey, Einsteins! Instead of torching your Nike's, how about burning a $100 bill and give the shoes to a homeless vet. Just do it!

A majority of the idiots Ive seen posting videos burning stuff seemed to be entitled young white men. Most likely people who are perfectly happy burning shit their parents bought. All because they have no concept of money and are terrified of a black mans message.
This reminds me both sides forget exactly what this is really about. Take a knee covers a very political directed issue that Kaepernick bit off on after enough people had it with MSM politics, after the Michael Brown riots & other support violent offenders events
Nike Taps Kaepernick For New Just Do It Ad¬†
Nike, Just Blew It
is the dumbest thing. Everyone just relax and send me your unwanted Nike apparel.
paid almost $200 for a pair Nike Shoes and you think my Ass is about to burn them because yall mad a black man is getting paid......
I have an idea. I'm going to refuse to wear no. 42 on Apr. 15 , 2019 because I don't think people should kill sharks just take their dorsal find.
Fun fact that the racists forget: Kaepernick checked with a vet before kneeling to make sure the act wasnt too disrespectful. The vet supported him.
Just picked up my new Nikes in support of
Boycotts rarely work. The counter-movement and the publicity usually benefits target.
Seriously, if only this outrage was the same outrage when Duck Trump threw my people of Puerto Rico paper towels during an emergency crisis in the Hurricane Maria aftermath...if only.
Where Democrats see Social Injustice...Conservatives see Whiny Little Opportunistic Bitches!
Those going on about are the same ones saying people were too sensitive when it came to
Going to join the , won't be hard because I can't afford their crap anyway
I love clicking on and seeing 95% in support of and
Will is still around. will be just fine. Im sure they make more money overseas anyway.
Id say yes but not because of kneeling Id say more about
Just Visited 911 Memorial and to see the powerful images of our flag and how our flag brought our people together to find the strength to survive was heart wrenching. Shame on C.K. and all the others. Shame on Nike
Yall have this same energy when these Jordans drop so its easier for me to cop mine
I was going to be buying new gym gear from you this week, but I guess I'll be taking my business elsewhere
is phony bullshit, anyway. Nike sales won't be affected to any noticeable extent. A few idiots might be burning old shoes they can't wear anyway, but mostly it's just a way for preening posturing country singers to get some cheap publicity.
I will not no one was boycotting them before making Kaepernick the face of new advertisement!!! Seriously. Y'all might want to cover up, your racism is showing. Ridiculous and disgusting, wheres this same boycotting and outrage for injustice, violence and equality?
So people are willing to destroy their Nike clothing & apparel? Well before you do, your local shelter would be willing to accept it. Use your hate for good by doing that. Either way, Nike already has your money.
Here we learn that the moral core of American Conservatism is proven by refusing to buy a brand of shoes.
The is fascinating. Its basically two groups arguing about the same thing using a completely different set of facts and assumptions.
The would be funnier if Nike was in the business of manufacturing white hooded robes.
We act like Nike is only bought in the USA. Its also sold to the rest of the world, and the rest of the world doesnt care whats going on in the USA.
So we just gon burn our Nike products now? Must be nice to have money to buy products of a specific brand only to burn them! Like nah fam. What ever happened to burning your bra?Forget about sending the instead
It's another great day to live in the USA!
Just Visited 911 Memorial and to see the powerful images of our flag and how our flag brought our people together to find the strength to survive was heart wrenching. Shame on C.K. and all the others. Shame on Nike
President of Iran: Death to AmericaKaepernick: Death to the PoliceNike JUST DO IT
Only thing the does is show how racist and divided this country gets
is leading to MAGA people hitting us with their brilliant knowledge of stock market. Hilarious
If you are taking part in the THAT MEANS YOU SUPPORT POLICE BRUTALITY AND DONT WANT OR DONT CARE ABOUT EQUALITY. YOUR EITHER WITH KAEP OR AGAINST HIM! ITS THAT SIMPLE! AND IF YOUR AGAINST HIM YOUR A RACIST!!!
Jordans are under Nike, so if yall tryna burn Jordans, just mail em to me: Size 12!!!
If your reaction to Nike featuring Kaepernick on an ad is to burn your clothing then youre definitely not stable enough to have a gun. Just sayin
"WE WILL NEVER FORGET" this either! I'll never wear terrorist clothing/shoes! I'm burning and supporting all the way! MY FLAG
If you're a size 13-14 in Nikes and you're supporting the please send me your shoes, I will burn them all in one epic bonfire.
When people boycott your company because of one wealthy man then other people support your company because of that same wealthy man and you just stuck working 30 hours a day for $.30
wait until the thousands upon thousands of Trumper Penn State fans realize their swag is made by Nike. LOLOLMFAO!!!!
The will not:Support American troopsCreate jobsCurtail illegal immigrationLessen the role of government It will:Provide yet another example of conservatives attacking a black person and make the awful, exploitative seem woke.
is hilarious. I don't usually buy Nike products but I'll be buying a pair of sneakers and a t-shirt just to spite the idiots
This call for a is so absolutely ridiculous.
I know! I'm gonna destroy things I already paid for to own the libs!No. Please. Stop owning us so hard by cutting up your personal property. I can't take being owned this hard.
, it's just a shoe company, get over it
Nike, Just Blew It
So trump supporters are buying Nikes to boycott Nike ? How smart
Be sure to destroy your iPhones because they have Nike apps on them,
I dont need to burn them just not support them any longer..speak with your wallet!!
The fact that people burning Nike products just shows how strong the racism still is. Just hidden a bit better now. THEY DONT UNDERSTAND THE MOVEMENT. THEY BIG MAD.
Are we boycotting nike because of who is on the poster or because of the words on the poster? And if we are just burning nike gear just give it away to people in and pay it forward to others.
Ive been stopping myself from buying shoes Ive been wanting cause I no longer buy shit I dont need, but today, today I got myself 3 pairs.
Do you have any essay, research paper,homework,article,thesis or online class that's stressing you? Don't worry, we will do it for you and deliver in time yet you pay a negotiable fee. DM us/email us your details- firstclasswriters6.com
Its a sad commentary in that we would rather be divided than come together to solve real problems, when did wearing pig socks and glorifying become reasoned dialog, huh ? being doesn't mean SHOUTING louder
Trump supporters (and that's ALL it is) are gonna find out they don't have the numbers or the purchasing power to affect anything more than a lazy yawn from Nike
5) Since yall love that anthem so much, did you know that we only sing the first verse and had to omit the rest because its all about how great slavery was and how it shouldnt have been abolished? But yall would probably be ok with that huh?
I buy Nike running gear anyway and this thing only makes me feel even better about myself.Which means that you Mango Mussolini loving retard fucks are basically running a really good advertising campaign for the company that you want to boycott.
Yo that seems a bit exaggerated. Sure that kapernick is an idiot but Nike is just virtue signaling. Companies are so fucked for supporting minorities like that
If you burn your Nike Apparel because they used Kaepernick in their ad....you's a damn fool, and you missed the entire point of the ad and Kaep's message.
Wait--there are ppl out there actually cutting up Nike paraphernalia they already OWN because they're mad over Nike supporting Kap? MBN to be able to throw away your own money. Whew chile...the stupidity!
I keep sayin.....all y'all doin the can send me ur gear, cause I'm poor AF & that shits expensive......
The people who are burning their attire are acting like two year olds that can't get their way, I support you Nike!!!!
I will be rocking these with my business suit... who really needs stilettos!
Whats wrong with people,Nike doesnt just sell in America so....have fun burning
Nike, Just Blew It
So you boycott by burning up Nike merchandise. Merchandise you already purchased. LMAO If that aint hustlin backwards, I dont know what is.
Here's how to properly:Take your shoes outside, set them on fire, and, as they burn, roast hot dogs over them. Then feed the hot dogs to your family.Then, poop in your Nike socks and flush them down the toilet. As many as you can.
Okay about this whole thing:You guys already paid for these shoes/socks/etc. Nike already has your money. Now you're just burning your own stuff. You might as well just set your money on fire. I swear, white people are so stupid.
I'm sorry people are attacking you. I've been there and it can get overwhelming. I don't agree with , but no reason to attack character. Just remember they're anonymous voices behind a screen. Good luck
I just bought cropped leggings/tights and new shoes for fall. We have a factory close by, too.
MLK was also ostracized by white Americans and today many pretend they liked him just as many one day will pretend they respected Collin Kaepernick.
is just corporatism attempting to buy your loyalty through propaganda.
If you destroy your clothing instead of donating it to the underprivileged because you want to show what a "patriot" you are, you're not a patriot. You're an asshole.
... For a man who makes millions upon millions of dollars in hands down the best country in the world if he actually wanted to make a difference, there are far better ways that would actually impact society. Kneeling is just dividing us even more.
I support you more than I ever have for having courage during this time of adversity. Not to assume that everyone boycotting Nike is lacking pigmentation, however you should know that Nike is a global corporation in a world in which you are the minority.
Just checkout
Imagine a world where you can be less than average at your job, hate your country, love Fidel Castro, and get paid millions, and become an icon for it
Just unfathomable that decides to go political and lose 50% of it's revenue. Stock already down 3% today. I wonder what actual shareholders think of this brilliant move. SMH
Excuse me whatever i get i must get 2. Me and bae will accept all gear from those boycotting....Thank you
Me at work when a customer say they support the
Hey, crowd, Under Armour has a deal with Stephen Curry, he plays on the Golden State Warriors, who shunned Donald Trump. Psst, Adidas has a deal with Damian Lillard, who has spoken positively of Kaepernick. Just saying, you burned your Nikes for nothing.
Nike also owns converse,so while y'all are burning your nikes products be sure to include those too. Just trying to help
busting this back out in light of the
'm not boycotting shit these are the same ppl that wanted to boycott Walmart over a damn shirt SIT DOWN
Nike sucks for their support of Kap. Support .
Kaepernick is not only anti-American by refusing to stand for the National Anthem he is also anti-police! SHAME ON YOU
Is pointless.....just is simple as that , and if you feel like you boycott Nike youre one of the problems with the nation/world
And this is the paradox of racism. The same people who "claim" to love Dr. Martin Luther King and Muhammad Ali for their fight against systemic injustice and bigotry are also the ones who hate and .
Racist people must really really hate Colin Kaepernick huh?
Never understood paying extra for socks because of a logo. Why should I pay them to advertise their product? Now youre going to destroy your overpriced socks because the company did something you dont like?
Seems like shareholders dont agree with their policy regarding Kaepernick. When will these corporate executives learn? Business and politics dont mix well.
Just Do It...get rid of the swoosh FOREVER in America. Cut it off! Never Nike!
Just Do It - Dump Nike
Multi-racial and tired of pasty white people thinking we need them to defend us, it's mighty racist of you.
So Republicans support , and Democrats support . And Im over here wearing Nike running shoes getting to In & Out as quick as I can.
Does sell bumper stickers. Because I sure as hell would stick Nike all over my car.
With respect to the ... Just a reminder that honoring the troops before nfl games is a paid marketing stunt.
While people who don't understand what a boycott is are out burning things they already paid for rather than doing something useful with them, I'll be out registering voters & knocking on doors to talk to people about the & why to vote blue.
Just an FYI; Nike will be absolutely fine without you.
it is dissapointing that you think these entitled athletes should come before or service men and women. These social justice warriors are wealthy, entitled, morons who obviously have just as many opportunities as anyone. Maybe they should help find a solution.
All those complaining about are the same ones that would sprint indoors to avoid standing for colors.
just burn it
Who the hell would allow a Trump supporter to play with fire, anyways?
If you was watching a horror movie you wouldn't have time for so follow me because we all float down here!
It doesnt matter if its a cross, a human being, or Nike merchandise... White America just loves burning stuff, history shows that.
Im just going to sit this here and let it soak.
So, if theyve had sweatshops forever then y just now the boycott?
Also want the self proclaimed Justice Warriors who turn a blind eye to this in their arguments to see their hypocrisy. And those who are now Boycotting Nike now over this ad but were fine with Nike before. Caring is relative I guess
Idgaf if it's Nike, Adidas, Puma or whatever. Good job for supporting Do MAGA think they are actually doing something positive with their ?
When he first started kneeling he had no agenda so what has this millionaire done for his cause and the rest of the disrespectful punks. You really think boycotting Nike will have no effect look at how many empty seats are at NFL games now
Isn't it odd that liberals support and gain support from the most capitalistic, most expensive shoe manufacturer, with most factories located in Asia - Indonesia, China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, Philippines, and Malaysia.
When the American population has divided themselves over Nike wear vs All the others, America has a problem.
for standing for justice equality
It would be interesting to see if any business reporting outfit reports this divesting of , and of others .
Well I'm obviously not going to take part in a . In fact I'm going to buy MORE Nike products and some stock in the company.
Can't believe people are actually boycotting .. Hear this, Phil Knight doesn't give a rat's ass if you don't buy his products. Phil Knight will continue to do what Phil Knight wants because Phil Knight understands the greater message
Dear Anyone Participating in the If you just so happen to be boycotting anything a size 10 1/2 or XXL please let your boy know
The POC $ count big time but this is NOT a race issue. It is Country vs. Nike. Thousands of POCs have gotten off of (and are FAST getting off of) the Lefty Dem Plantation, and their MENTAL PRISONS!! Wait & watch!!
I'm doing the same
So people weren't upset that Nike uses sweatshop labor to make their products, but they ARE upset about them hiring someone for a campaign for racial and social justice...your cards are showing, people.
Hurt in the worst way: boil your shoes in a pressure cooker for 45mins to 1 hr; let the shoes cool and julienne them; pat dry;saut√© in a skillet with 1 Tide pod per shoe (adjust to taste) for 3 minsMakes single serving! Please share your videos!
I can't participate in the because I stopped buying their products years ago. My Nike running shoe fell apart after 10 miles. Tried a 2nd pair and same thing happened. Never looked back.
Whew Chile... the racism is just popping out. Yall are sick in the head.
Impeach Trump just do it!
Nike¬†product has become synonymous with slave wages, forced overtime and arbitrary abuse. ...¬†Nike¬†and¬†child¬†labour had become indelibly linked in the public consciousness.¬†Nike began to take the first steps. It released the names and locations of its factories.
When you're burning your Nike stuff make sure you wear it at the same time. It makes for a better effect to own the Libs!
Nah Im good. Do yall bigots know how comfortable Roshes are??? I literally own three pairs and Im copping some new ones just for Kap being the new face of their company. Tuh.
Live look-in at the morning meeting at Nike Headquarters when they realize stocks opened down over 3% for a total loss of just under $4B.
I wasnt going to buy one because: (1) that design ... my eyes!; and (2) Im a 52 year old man, but now Count Trumpulas legion of doom has started a its time to blow the dust off my debit card.
Oclean Air Intelligent APP Control Sonic Electrical ToothbrushGET IT HERE:
You'd think that these "patriots" supporting the would do something patriotic with their Nike apparel like give it to Vets in need instead of burning it. Guess they just want attention instead of doing something productive.
Burning or Buying?Either way is, as Charlie Sheen used to say, "Duh, winning." I'll discuss on today's PhilCast show later today at
is a louse
. lost me, and my entire family, as customers last night. No need for businesses to get political.
Just DUMP your Nike Stock
It would be so much easier if everyone boycotting Nike just threw all their Nike apparel in a duffle bag, hiked to the top of an active volcano and hopped in with it.
Nike has lost my business....they will feel it. Its all my kids wear....at least they used to. Congrats to and for gaining some new business today.
It's time to admit that the human race is a failed experiment and maybe we should just close up shop.
Whole lot of idiots doing this thing, probably supporters with how they act like babies. Good on you and , keep up the good work.
My pair of nikes are on fire .No I didn't light it on fire they're just look that good. Flames
Nike you've officially lost your way. What happened to the girl I used to love? Too bad and adios.
Just seen that was trending. Yall really some sick individuals. Go sit on some train tracks bruh.
There Once was a Company named nikeWho made sneakers that people likeThen they backed the BIGGEST OF PUSSIESKaepernick ~ KING of the WussiesAnd America said TAKE A HIKE
Idiot: The libs are going to riot if they win the election. Same Idiot: Now, watch me set my shoes on fire in this .
Instead of supporting law enforcement Nike hires cop hater & racist
I have boycotted Nike since they began their Just Do It campaign. Not the message I want to send to my children.
Gonna proudly wear my Nike shirt today to support
Still waiting for that Trump-Tweet including "", "failing ", "low rates", "sad" - and the proof, that 45 still wants us to think, keeled to disrespect the flag.
I got benched for Blane Gabbert.. I opted out of a $15,000,000 contract..I divided the country with one silly gesture..I am...
impeach Trump just do it!
Yall must be so proud to be following Putins machinations (google it).
has caused to lose $4 billion in market cap. $NKE
Okay genius, what does Nike have to do with public utilities?
Nike just committed suicide!
Please stop using Patriotism to hide your prejudice against black & brown people.
....Would that be equivalent to not flying the White House Flag at Half staff because you didn't view a P.O.W. as a war hero? Just checking....
Ahh FYI for all you independent thinkers lol who say boycott let me remind u that and were planning on using kinda puts y'all in a spot
Nike getting their assholes kicked out this morning people burning their sneakers Military throwing their shoes out windows hope Colin Kaepernick was worth it cause you just destroyed the BRAND.
Redneck Riviera. 208 Broadway, Nashville, TN 37201 (615) 436-4070. Thats John Richs place of business. Send Niked up postcards.
Senate Dems united in on . Let's make it trend!
Wow my Nikes are looking rough. Time for a new pair. I've been a long time Nike customer and will remain a long time Nike customer.PS - if you're participating in the please donate your clothes and shoes to a charity.
see a lot of people celebrating early losses from Nike in the opening day since the Kaepernick announcement.Nike is up huge in 2018...not that big a deal!Having said that, choosing a front man who wears socks depicting law enforcement as pigs is DISGUSTING.
My Ex-army buddy just posted this.I'm literally in awe
And just like that, Leftists began to defend and promote a corporation that makes its products in child sweat shops. The anti-corporate left is dead.
Just SOME of my thoughts on the Kaepernick issue. Remember, theres always two sides to every story, and often times they each have truths to them.
Nike peut-il perdre gros en mettant en sc√®ne Colin Kaepernick dans sa derni√®re campagne ¬´ Just Do It ¬ª ?
The got me like ‚ÄòHelp Us All Home Sweet Homeless Shelter Seems like some snobbish Americans have money to burn while others cant afford a pair of work . I believe in the power of
Nike disrespected America and all the troops that fought and died for our country by promoting Commie Kaepernick. This guy refuses to stand for our Anthem and openly supports communist police state dictator Fidel Castro. Nike hates America.
If Nikes stock is down, it just means its a good time to buy that stock.
Nike doesn't care if you cut up your socks you got 5 years ago lol or burn that 7 year old shirt you had! "You just lost a customer"
If you're going to burn your Nike gear on video in support of the be sure to keep those clothes, shoes, and hat ON. Show how committed you really are.
Legit it's sad and ridiculous this is trying to happen. Like y'all are racist asf!!
People are actually destroying Nike clothing in an attempt to promote Americanism? Dont they realize Nike is an American company? I mean the idea of the is ridiculous anyway, but come ON people. Do SOMETHING productive and not these meaningless displays of tribalism
This whole is ridiculous! You all better be boycotting for justice pertaining to the lives of . . . . It's probably a whole bunch of people who defended the Charlotsville thing.
Some people still dont get the point. Players dont kneel cause they hate the flag, hate the anthem or hate the troops.
Just Walk Away!
I will proudly wear these to work today. I STAND with Nike in support of equality and justice for ALL!!
My people walking in the store to cop alllll the nike shits bcus we been doing that
Siempre fue m√°s f√°cil que buscar el brillo ¬øverdad?Apost√°is la eficacia y no la virtud
Seeing trending this morning as a result of their campaign with Colin Kaepernick. I bought 4 pairs of Nikes just last week and I'm still going to continue supporting their brand. Love the campaign, keep it up!
America, focus today on the man about to become SCOTUS judge, willing to change the platform on conservative decisions becoming law in our country. Don't focus on that's just a deter from Kavanaugh, which should be the main focus TODAY!
Y'all should should hmu with them shoes I'll burn them for you trust me.
) black people are the biggest consumers in America and yall think we aren't gonna support NIKE when they're supporting Kaepernick lol B) Nike doesnt just sell in America so....have fun burning things u already paid for some people will be racist
If all the Trump supporters that exercised joined the , the shoe company would lose $32.50, tops.
is CRAPAre you seriously gonna tell me that this is what We have come to PURE BS.Get your crap together people fight for important topics in America. You people are making Kaepernick, a household name, LET IT GO. Buy other products. Not Nike.Easy Peasy.
If the is serious, here is a link of college programs with Nike sponsorship (as of 2017). Does this means no more supporting your favorite college team if they're with Nike?
burn your shit, just know that you already contributed to Nike by wasting YOUR money on their items
: supports KaepernickMe: burns all of my
WTH3LL did Nike think was going to happen when they spit in the face of millions of American consumers? The nfl is staying away from bc he is toxic.It makes no sense to start a fire just for fun
The people who have some money are waiting for stock to go down low enough to scoop it up. Great . I see them watching it and talking about it. They love it, because they're gonna make some bucks.
Colin Kaepernick could have signed with the Baltimore Ravens last season.His Muslim girlfriend torpedoed that opportunity for her Anti-American boyfriend. John Brennan Kavanaugh
remember the same ones raging against Nike.... wear cheap hats made in China that say make America great... and applauded a draft dogging a hole who mocked a dying veteran.
Think before you burn your NikeNike supports black athletesAdidas supports self hating black peopleWhite privilege burning Nike instead of giving to the needy?MAGA? True colors show by whats on our feet now? Dont do 3 stripes
Hey Trump supporters.... If you dont have any books, Nikes are the next best thing.
Think I might buy new pairs of Huaraches & 270s because I'm sooo committed to the
Now that you mention it,i think I'm gonna buy a few pair of Nike's.Besides can replace those ignorant ass redhat customers.Plenty of other markets abroad they can sell to.They wont even feel it.
I love how all the racists in my mentions got quiet. Must be difficult getting facts handed to you by a black woman. Who knew?Whatever you do, never let them win.
sick about everything being about race .... we all should be on the same damn team... we all are Americans.... we can come together cheering for our favorite sports team but second we walk out of the stadium or arena we allow crap like this to divide us....
Just bought 4 - yes count them - 4 pairs of sneakers yesterday! No here.
The makes want to buy a bunch of Nike merchandise just to be petty
Since has come out in support of Convenience Store Robber Americans rather than the police, here are some new shoe names for you -Nike PerpetratorNike IntruderNike InvaderNike JackerNike SliderNike HustlerNike TraffickerNike Line UpNike Strong Arm&
An example of a jackass supporting
a Veteran who's family has been homeless before I ask those who are supporting the to donate that money they are withholding to organizations that combat the issue of Vet homelessness. If you are boycotting for Vets you can help Vets.
Clearly the people boycotting Nike are all about what Jesus would do.
I still support ... and of course I applaud A white supremacist boycott is an oxymoron. The goddess Nike has spoken!
was here before Trump and will remain after him. People who are doing the Boycott are just ignorant and are following their leader as brainless cheeps. I'm going to buy Nike even more now.
I wont even buy a Nikkon camera now because its just too close to
:God chose NIKE because in God's wisdom He knew that racists and conservatives would have little impact on His decision.GOD is GOOD!! GOD is WISE!!
is trending because of everyone tweeting how preposterous the idea is
shows more amd more companies are willing to become "political" to tell racist Trump supporters they don't give a shit about doing business with them. That's fantastic.
Anybody who understands what has been doing, and the politics behind it, knows that the decision was a no-brainer for . Why *wouldn't* a major brand want this generation's Muhammad Ali on its ads? morons & their is deliciously amusing.
Do y'all racists ever get tired of completely missing the point of something/someone?I just look at the mental gymnastics y'all attempt to do to justify y'all ignorance and hate, and I just get exhausted reading it trying to understand it.Y'all are really dumb.
Instead of burning or ruining Nike products, how about you just donate it to a local shelter or kids center.
Good Morning Just incase you've missed my poll this morning. Make sure to vote!! Thanks JL
After reading the Colin Kaepernick posts Im guessing he just proved his NFL conspiracy case as well. Lot of WHITE RACISTS in America.
Im shocked! A company that got rich and renown from black athletes is supporting them? .....neck...ass...boi lol ya'll really mad about something ya'll are choosing to ignore.
People boycotting: *buys nike merchandise and burns it* YEAAAH TAKE THAT NIKE!Nike & colin supporters: *Buys more nike merch* NIKE: *Looks at sales still rising* JUST DO IT! THIS BOYCOTT IS REDUNDANT
La derecha estadounidense llamando al y los SJW elogiando a la marca por sus √∫ltimos spots militantes. Qu√© lejos quedaste No Logo.
Thank you Taaraka!!! Youre support for the men & women in blue means so much . I appreciate your loyalty to our NikeBoycott. We feel your Love and support all the way from India! Youre Awesome!!!
If you're part of any Nike doesn't fucking care about you. Seriously. They knew there would be backlash and THEY DON'T FUCKING CARE ABOUT YOUR OPINION. You are fucking powerless. Your opinion means shit. Stop it.
The is to distract from the (and I'm not calling them "" because I am not presuming that Kavanaugh will be illegitimately confirmed. Illegitimate POTUS = Illegitimate appointees = Illegimate conformations.).
I must say, is to boycott everything for a few days then be over with it the new cool thing to do? Last week it was and this week it is , , or . What will it be next, for likes. Just my .
you can't boycott Nike why would you because they chose an American Hero to be their spokesperson
Funny how folks criticizing Nike over Kaepernick and sweatshop abuse switching over to Adidas like their sweatshops don't share the same address/employees
The just made the swoosh the universal symbol of tolerance, understanding and sympathy. Everybody wearing a visible Nike symbol will get a fist bump starting today...
Lmfao is really a thing? All because a black guy is the face of Nike
I cant help but wonder how many ppl supporting the actually know ALL of the words to the Star Spangled Banner?
I fully understand why he does it , I fully support why he does it and I will support his fight for equality and to stop rampant police brutality Worldwide
Republicans: YOU LIBTARD SNOWFLAKES GET OFFENDED BY ANYTHING! *Nike makes Kap the face of their campaign* Also Republicans: THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS, BOYCOTT *burns Nike apparel*
You poor folks go buy your Nike gear. Us rich white folk will stay with Under Armour. Since we havent bought Nike since early 2000s
Let me set the shoes on my feet on fire, thatll stick it to those coloreds at Nike. Racism and stupidity really are synonymous.
RT : ...and now, ?Y'all just like burning stuff, don't you?
The POC $ count big time but this is NOT a race issue. It is Country vs. Nike. Thousands of POCs have gotten off of (and are FAST getting off of) the Lefty Dem Plantation, and their MENTAL PRISONS!! Wait & watch!!
this is insane to me, is fighting for equality and to bring awareness to the injustice that black Americans are facing and all anyone is doing is posting pictures of dead white soldiers saying "this guy sacrificed everything" like fuck off please!
Since there is a Nike Boycott are these same people going to Boycott there universities that are Nike sponsored schools.
Imagine being so calloused to the plight of your fellow country men, one would destroy his own posessions vs identifying and accepting a reality. THAT my friends=American history. It's also America present. "Land owning " "planter class" would rather burn it all up
the majority of supporters actually engage in any physical fitness. .
Also: Let me make this clear. This is not a lib vs con thing (I have no affiliation with either) Its simply this. If you support the because they sponsor a man who gave up his whole damn career to stand (or kneel) for something bigger than himself: Youre wild.
Vote with your dollars -- supports worthy causes like
Hey morons.. instead of how about you donate those things to homeless vets who have nothing? You want to show you love your country? Do that, instead of burning cloths people could actually use. Think about it...
didn't like the way the country was going so he ran for the presidency. Since Kaepernick is against racial injustice by the police force perhaps he should join the police force to fix it.
If you are joining the because you think that Colin 's is unAmerican then you are either super clueless or a terrible person.
Hi I just did it.
Cap isn't trying to save no one but himself. They're great players out in the community's making . Give them the deal
Anyone supporting the can stop following us. You are clearly on the wrong side of history
I find it curious none of the white guilt folks angry over are mentioning Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's support of Colin Kaepernick.
How long until all the people joining the are classified as racists because of how ignorant they are with the whole Kap kneeling for the anthem situation
This is silly. But it gives me hope that will consider me for an awesome inspiring ad if theyre just choosing anyone.
This is literally the dumbest boycott ever created and i just want to know why? Like give me real facts on why yall want to really boycott Nike.
A because a man is taking a stand against a systemic problem? I prefer . Way bigger problem, as proven by your recent election.
how ridiculous
This is a real thing, how many of you really think you are hurting Nike because you dont want to wear there stuff.Its a whole other side of people running and ordering Nike gear.
Nike is way bigger outside of the USA.
The folks are about "boot straps" and "individualism"...they have no mind to think about a group or community as a whole. The veterans, law enforcement, and the flag are pawns in their pretentious indignation!
On a serious note.. the Nike shoes yall throwing away due to your hatred for Nike could be easily donated to the less fortunate.. js.
Nah, just donate em people
Redneck Riviera. 208 Broadway, Nashville, TN 37201 (615) 436-4070. Thats John Richs place of business. Send Niked up postcards.
THE FACT THAT IS TRENDING CAUSE WHAT SAID IS HORRIBLE.......
Bear in mind: If you chose proper & qualified people for your Supreme Court Justice, you will automatically solve the problem of racism, gender inequality & alike in the USA. Focus on Confirmation instead of wasting your resources for a thrown ball like
The Tussle of being an Adeleke and also Having a Chioma ‚Äì - Miracle
If I don't see not one pair of Jordan's destroyed in this then y'all not serious lmao. And don't hit me with "well technically Jordan is his own brand now"
People need to wake up and listen to the real message vs what they want to hear. congrats on your deal. just used the line to everyone who doesnt like the deal I dont need you, you need me -Apeshit
Maybe instead of burning all the Nike gear you have, maybe donate it to goodwill or a homeless shelter. Seeing as how there are many homeless veterans in the US that could use the help. Show support for the troops that way if you believe kneeling to be disrespectful
I feel like the doesnt go far enough. Are people aware, for instance, that Kap is ALSO supported by oxygen, food, and water? The liberal deception runs deep.
Us eastern Europeans don't care about
this is just silly a bunch of redneck men wearing Ivanka Trump high heels
Hilarious when the pro kaepernick people are driving to on twitter.
Remember when Michael Jackson sold the Beatles song "revolution quoteto Nike to use an ad campaign and Paul McCartney got angry because of the sweatshop labor?
't it odd that a company who makes 100% of the goods they sell in 3rd world countries paying shit wages decided they were the face of social justice ?. - redefining
I could destroy my 's, but destroying a pair of $80 shoes, then having to go buy a new pair, seems just a little stupid
Yall maga hat, trump supporting patriotic racist are quick to say kap is disrespectful to the flags and the vets but yall out here burning clothes and shoes instead of taking shit YOU ALREADY PAID FOR and donating to homeless vets since you love your country so much
I am already long timer customer of champ which is made in the USA for REAL
The POC $ count big time but this is NOT a race issue. It is Country vs. Nike. Thousands of POCs have gotten off of (and are FAST getting off of) the Lefty Dem Plantation, and their MENTAL PRISONS!! Wait & watch!!
So, the economys booming, record low unemployment, everybodys soo prosperous in todays ... But the winners are still screaming their heads off. Maybe if Kap was white youd be more
boycott them because materialism is bad not because you are a trumpkin
The same people upset that folks are supporting a are the same fools who wanted to boycott In And Out burger...the lulz. Hypocrites everywhere.
That's because nobody's boycotting them. I don't know where you get your information, but it's not in the real world.Must be Twitter. LMAO
So am I to assume anyone tweeting support for Nikes decision to make this dude with the big hair who already has millions of dollars their poster child supports kneeling during the National Anthem or is just anti Trump?
Maybe with all these people boycotting theyll lower their prices. I just want a pair of Nike Cortez for my 7 month old.
you really need a justified reason to boycott.....waiting ...nothing huh.
Management is doing more than the Whitehouse to protect America
Estados Unidos se dividi√≥ entre los que apoyan a Donald Trump y quienes no est√°n de acuerdo con la mayor√≠a de sus posiciones pol√≠ticas, (sociales √©ticas) ah√≠ decidi√≥ entrar Nike y en las redes se abri√≥ el debate: apoyo o boicot.Ejem: vs .
Just as it was ridiculous people were boycotting In-N-Out for donating to the Republican Party, it is just as ridiculous people are boycotting Nike for their Kaepernick ad
If youre taking part in the please dont destroy your old gear. Nike doesnt give a shit what you do with the products youve already paid for and you just look like a dumbass. Atleast donate your old stuff. Help others while sticking to your morals.
Until  pisses away the $43M hes earned in his short lived career, he hasnt sacrificed anything. Other than future money he would have earned if it werent for his ridiculous stance on the Flag.
How NIKEs dissing of our Country affects you and America.
is a disgusting company now. They .
why is trending here in england, I dont think anyone cares because it has nothing to do with us
. Wow ! These "endorsements" say it all ! If a communist and a former dictator of a brutal regime endorse you, you must be one hell of a loser and stand errrrr kneel for the most UNAMERICAN principals!
Just Do It I dont even wear tennis shoes & I buying multiple pairs of Colin shoe & donating them! Gotta keep 1 pair as a collectible item tho! Love this brother!
9.4.2018 together xmas came early lol between this & the I want popcorn & fireworks!! via
, you epitomize everything WRONG with the USA! Its why we deplorables are fighting so hard to get it back...and we will!
(2 of 5)-only when shot by police officers?! If you feel young black men are being unjustly murdered then you MUST also support officers that respond to shootings of black men against black men shootings EVERY night in EVERY city!
Nike has to be super confused that the sweatshops were cool with all y'all but having kaep as a model crossed the line
can take a knee at Home Depot just as easily as he can on an NFL sideline. The difference is he wants to get paid millions to do it.
Disrespect your country, law and order, scarifies of the men and women, flag and national anthem? No problem, Just do it. Nike awards Colin Kaepernick with a slap on our faceBecause McCains burial is officially over, no need to pretend fake patriotism anymore
boycott them because materialism is bad not because you are a trumpkin
Yo Dont BURN infamous CHECC just give all that shit to me
For those destroying their clothes because they made the face of their 30th anniversary, please consider donating it to or any other charity that supplies clothing for families, children, veterans and/or homeless
Dear "conservatives"Ive seen you at your rallies. You are not an athletic shoes manufactuer's target customer.
How can I show just how patriotic I am and how much a respect vets at the same time? Oh, I know I'll burn all these perfectly good clothes & shoes instead of donating where a homeless vet can use them. AWEE HELL YEAH. GET BAITED, NIKE!!
To all the WHITE SUPREMACY supporters keep Teeeting, the NSA and the FBI are creating a new database as you tweet.
Yes, the POC $ count big time but this is NOT a race issue. It is Country vs. Nike. Thousands of POCs have gotten off of (and are FAST getting off of) the Lefty Dem Plantation, and their MENTAL PRISONS!! Wait & watch!!
All points should be discussed. Why do Cops enter war zones each day in inner cities and neighborhoods? Male role models (sports athletes, rappers) frequently have multiple children with many women, generational government dependency > education, etc
disrespecting our country, and our flag, and our servicemen. Really ? You know widows and fatherless children are handed that folded up flag because daddy wont ever come home again. These "oppressed" people making 14 million a year playing catch
For those who are interested in REAL social justice, not just the Trendy American version.
For those destroying their clothes because they made the face of their 30th anniversary, please consider donating it to or any other charity that supplies clothing for families, children, veterans and/or homeless
There are literally shoeless kids being baited into stealing sneakers and some people are burning their Nike kicks because of an ad. Recognize your privilege. ()
can y'all plz telling me your reason for this because ya boy not understanding.
Does your sound guy even know how to use a pair of scissors? You holier than thou southern bigots should stick to making shitty alcohol and singing male stripper songs...
This is the irony about the / debacle : exploited our political and cultural divide; y'all have no concerns about child labor abuse but y'all have many concerns when a black man is endorsed. That's what you call RACIST & UNPATRIOTIC!
I don't know why white people are mad at , they never respected nor honored their own flag. Valor & Bravery where? and LOL at Purity & Innocence. Vigilance, Perseverance, and Justice, really? I have so much respect for Nike
To all the Dumb Asses Cuttin yo Shit, just Relize , they making more Money off y'all Now stupid
boycott them because materialism is bad not because you are a trumpkin
These angry and racist people must be rich. No way will I be that pressed to burn a pair of sneakers because of anger. You really have to make an impact on my soul to have me burn some $200 sneakers.
Some of those that burn Nikes, are the same that burn crosses.¬†
I don't need to because I'm smart enough to not pay a premium for a brand name in the 1st place.I find kneeling for the anthem offensive, but I also understand he didn't intend it that way.My issue is the campaign slogan of "sacrifice everything."
Police brutality? he supports Castro! Does even have a clue or do the clowns who support him have a clue?
I could care less about this silly but then again, I care even less about Colin Kaepernick. Just saying......
Well I just brought 3 pairs of Nike woo hoo!
These haven't just jumped the shark, they've jumped the entire friggin aquarium!
I still support ... and of course I applaud A white supremacist boycott is an oxymoron. The goddess Nike has spoken!
Nike watching Go ahead, just do it
Just bought a pair of NIKE Women's Ultra Comfort Thong Sandals. via
So along with the we have Trump supporters promising to boycott Walmart, Target, Amazon, Harley Davidson, etc. Soon they'll be bartering sheep for a pair of shoes. ALSO  Most of those company stocks are UP over the last six months.
People debating the merits of Nike and I'm like "meh." I've boycotted them since I was 20yrs old because they exploit workers abroad and undermine democracy.
The is bringing out the worst in Trump supporters as Nike knew it would. These idiots are now ruining their own clothing while oozing with racism and Nike isn't suffering one bit. I. Can't. Stop. Laughing.
these Nike Pegasus 35s cost me $120. Aint no way Im burning these.
I will gladly give up any and all products to support my brothers and sisters in blue! Shameful that has chosen to side against our law enforcement men and women!
they forgot who built America. It only took Montgomery so long to see the effects of the Montgomery Bus Company Boycott.
I will follow a just bought some New Balance shoes, so isn't too difficult for me anyway :)
all I can say about the is that none of yall that are public ally defacing the brand look like me... yall so damn quick to wanna cut up some damn Nike but cant cut the n-word from yall vocabulary, cut microagression out yall day, cut us a reparation check... oh
lol who cares just wear shoes whats the point
Nike: Thank you for your patronage, you can burn them, use them to masturbate with, do whate you want with them, we don't care, we still have have your money. Ha!
Last night I took back the Jordans I bought for my grandsons for school. I hope others do the same. Nike is an UN-American company and they will NEVER have my business.
Everybody who is supporting this is a clear racist and can go to hell. Fuck you, your kids and everything that comes after
I was never a big fan of $500 shoes pieced together by armies of 9 year olds anyway.
As a nurse who cares for our Vets, I can tell you, U should have donated those to a vet, a lot of them need it. Fake outrage and tweets, meanwhile a homeless vet could have used those smh.
Les Americains penses pouvoir Boycott Nike ?? NIKE ? La marque la plus puissant du monde avec LVMH ? impossible arr√™t√© votre cin√©ma
So the is yet to visit troops in Iraq or Afghanistan, doesn't know the words to the National Anthem and wants billions of dollars for a wall instead of housing and feeding on the streets yet somehow is unpatriotic.
Don't let be distracted by or not boycotting Nike at this critical time. Use your energy & resources in an efficient manner on a more important issue like Nomination. (Everybody might throw various types of balls toward you to distract you. Should u follow
When I was younger, calls for a centered on ending foreign sweatshop labour. Now its about fulfilling some sort of narcissistic moralism. Says a lot about the focus of our attention.
People are boycotting Nike to show their support for extrajudicial police shootings.
Look !When I watch an game, I watch to be entertained and not to have 's political bullshit shoved down my throat!I've supported your company for decades but I think I may have purchased my last pair
yep I just did it! Sold my stock and boycotting here on.
A ? Seriously? All the white folks cutting and burning yall Nike shit, yall look racist af, but thats none of my business
Though I am disgusted with hiring and support the , I'm not going to burn my shoes or otherwise destroy them. I don't like wasting my hard earned money. That being said, my next pair is going to be from a different company.
Just burned my socks because I was wearing Toms and the two do NOT belong together
Burning, tearing and cutting your Nike shoes and socks is not going to destroy the big business and other multimillion dollar companies. Also if youre only doing this because Kaepernick became a spokesman for them, save your faux outrage you hypocrites.
I own maybe 2 or 3 pairs of Nike (Imma Adidas guy) but imma buy more Nike gear besides my Falcons stuff because of this Kaepernick deal I love it honestly and yes I served in the military so dont come at me with foolishness.
please let me know, what Nike has done for the black communityBesides exploiting.

Y'all are really not going to wear Nikes anymore because of Colin? His name is Colin.. y'all are sad
If you burn your Nike clothes as part of the in support of police brutality, please be sure you're wearing them when you do.
stores in the USA should not carry Nike merchandise Any longer. I sure won't buy anymore.
Basic human decency > blind nationalism. I support Kaepernick.
Because I support my country and the blue line
Throws Nike shoes into furnace.Stands back and smiles: Just do it.
This is hilarious. They arent losing any money when you burn shit you bought, so just leave it on when you set it ablazecya
This faux outrage is undoubtedly being fueled by the Russian disinformation machine. Dont buy into it!

Imagine burning and boycotting wearing comfortable quality shoes because the brand that makes them supports a positive message .Could never be me.Also they don't need your sale they're a fortune 500 company.
People are torching used shoes with a market value of $5 and Twitters blue checkmarks are up in arms about how its wasteful. Meanwhile Nike is torching 30+ year customer relationships and their own stock price, for social signaling points.
Dear , you completely missed the mark on your . The people who risk their lives every day for a greater purpose do not wear a uniform. Why didnt u use one of our great men & women in or ??? Nike
People that are are the same people that . Theyre still gunna wear nike stuff in weeks to come & watch their football team clowns
O there is a thing happening because of Colin kaepernick? Me in my Nike gear:
I just can't believe these people really burning and cutting their Nike stuff like who knew Nike supporting one black man would hurt this many white people the is dumb asf and Nike already got your money so it don't matter
want to burn your own stuff? just do it. The Veterans who lost/sacrificed their lives and limbs and their families who saw them off, or hoped and prayed they would come home, are being disrespected. Shame on Nike, their the ones that should donate to Veterans.
'RE BURNING MERCHANDISE NIKE ALREADY GOT PAID FOR! Nike won't be missing y'all- trust.
Dear Nike:I just did it. Buh-bye!
I have a great idea for getting rid of unwanted Nike stuff DONATE IT TO PEOPLE WHO NEED IT! SMH..... I for one support Nike in what they are doing and no way support this damn stupid ....IT'S DUMB!
You are mistaken. was kneeling because black men were getting shot by the police. But valiant attempt to distort his message to your narration. Kneeling in front of the flag is . Your "restatement" of his actions is ridiculous and perfidious.

I know one thing all you cornball hypebeast hypocrites that are boycotting Nike make sure you keep that same energy when those Off-White Blazers drop in a week.
just do It
I feel like the is a missed opportunity to sell a "Conservative Tears" mug...
Used to think that were dooms day preppers were dumbasses but I stand corrected by the revolt! If the sweat shops used to make your merchandise wasnt a red line but taking a knee is then you are morally bankrupt!
Nike are you really trying to ruin your brand? You just lost a customer here! Maybe you should consider using real heroes from the military to represent your brand!
THE SAME PEOPLE MAD AT THE LIBS BOYCOTTING IN n OUT, ARE THE SAME PEOPLE BURNING SHOES. but WERE the snowflakes... OK
Kap hasnt kneeled for an anthem in over two years and white folks still cant let the man love his life and move on. He sacrificed his career MAKING MILLIONS to stand up for injustices in this country. Theres nothing more American.
You just know, somewhere in the U.S.A., there's some moron boycotting Nike who has a Nike tattoo.
Hey, real talk if youre participating in the dont destroy the product, send it to me and Ill get it to someone in need. Im being 100% serious.
, lol are all so serious?
That could be said for every boycott that comes across twitter. Now here is where your confused. There has been zero energy put behind because it is just a bunch of people typing on their keyboards. The same as every boycott that comes across twitter.
If dropped a new album he would go diamond from all the white ppl buying every album they can just to burn them. The whites are at it again yall
I'm going to continue to wear all my , and gear today and everyday because I'm not an uptight bigot. The end.
Shirt Kaepernick wore while "explaining" his position created such deep animosity that legitimate concerns presented by him were sincerely lost. Labels of racism against opposition are deflection and spurious.
Guaranteed 90% of the people participating in the didnt bat an eye when the company got busted for sweatshops.SIDE NOTE: If any of yall are throwing or burning your shit just send it my way
I'm going to toss my Nikes* today.... because I just bought a new pair. And 2 packs of Nike socks. Thanks for making good quality footwear, ! ? I with .* into the closet. Imma still gunna wear 'em when I mow the lawn.
Nike down over 3% in pre-market trading. Dont let the Kaepernick story distract you from the fact Nike still uses Chinese child slave labor to assemble their products.

Dear - I wanted to let you know that I just placed an order to thank you for making the face of your 30th Anniversary campaign. Should make up for a few of those cut-up socks you might have read about.
I have an Idea for NIKE...let's sponsor an East St Louis Race and call it "The Run FOR YOUR LIFE Marathon" just do it !!!
NIKE hires slave and child labor.....slavery is over is the West only...that is why they are trying to destroy us.
I just read some of the most racist tweets ever on those hashtags
This is a difficult one, and the campaign by Nike could actually end up harming sales, it's been seen in other areas that pushing agendas doesn't neccessarily mean more money is made from those you're targeting, whereas there could be losses from other areas.
Hey - Are you making a special line of shoes as cops dressed as pigs? You just lost a lifelong customer. Shopping for some Made in USA today.
This what yall dont get about the Its about challenge the blacks dont buy to support ideal and show what happens when the tides turn.EVERYTIME a company denounces black people their profit declines BUT THIS TIME!Youll see what happenes when they have our backs

I wouldnt be surprised if the hashtag was being pushed by Russians to sow division and hate once again...
I am confusion
Yall realize doesnt give a fuck if you burn your clothes or your shoes? You ALREADY PAID FOR THEM. People are just doing shit for the attention. Step up and focus on the real problem.....
Come help out and support businesses!!!
Acting like the will actually hurt them is stupid. Especially the people who bought Nike stuff and are now burning it. Y'all are just wasting your own money and giving it to them.
There are people cutting up their Nike apparel because The company sign Colin Kaepernick for an endorsement deal. Im sorry Regardless of your views, why would you rip up your own stuff?
many homeless & disadvantaged veterans, most who also support btw, could benefit from your misguided wastefulness. You have hurt no one, might as well help the people you claim to do everything in the name of
So you are burning your sneakers because Nike has an ad with a man who would like accountability to be universal. When did patriotism get conflated with tribalism? Oh, when marketing "the other" as the enemy was used to mantain power. Ignorance is around here.
Trump supporters: The left is so sensitive and entitled. Also Trump supporters: (*screech at the phrase Happy Holidays) (*burn Jerseys of NFL players that took the knee) (*burn all Nike products they own because of Colin Kaepernick)Stay mad
Just say yall blatantly racist and move on

In the news today: Crusty old white dudes who havent ran farther than the fridge since the county championship game in ‚Äò72 burn their sports shoes.

I cant understand this world that we live in, burning Nike stuff because Nike supports a movement to bring attention to racial injustice?? is
Pretty much a NO, NOT NIKE consensus...did you fire any of your slave laborers yet?
Instead if destroying them how about you donate to someone in need or a local donation center. Just because you don't support it doesn't mean it doesn't have value to someone.
If I boycotted everyone I am supposed to disagree with I would be naked and I would starve. Kat Timpf I tend to agree. Lets just chill.

There are plenty of other clothes & shoes to give to charity. No need to keep the Nike logo circulating. Find another excuse, libs.
The says don't . This guy loves his and business is BOOMING don't f*K with Pr
The way white Americans are reacting to supporting Kaepernick is the same way white America reacted to the Emancipation of Slavery Proclamation.
Folks are idiots....sure, get all outraged over while folks in Flint still can't drink water. Send me all ur gear cause I'm poor as hell & that shits expensive!
Thank you for sticking up. The will last two min. You dont want racists as your customers anyway.
Is it so hard to understand what the meaning of the kneeling of during the National Anthem is? This fucking retards and their , burning their shoes and cutting the "Swoosh" off their clothes are just pathetic.
The secret:1) Define Your Outcome2) Take Massive Daily Action3) Make Adjustments Towards it's Achievement.4) Enjoy the Journey As Much As The Destination.
Hey to all the trumpers, just do it.
I was thinking the same thing? 14 hours since tweeted? Still sleeping since the story broke, or has his head just exploded Or is he too busy making Stephen burn all his Nike stuff?
People that are pissed about the campaign should donate their stuff to homeless vets instead of burning it. Do something useful for once.
This is a great time to come support business.
I am going to go spend a ton of money on Nike stuff just so I can burn it. Two own the libs.
FUUURIOUS! How disrespectful!!!!!!
So yall boycotting Nike for this but not for its business model practices. This country in a word is fucked up!
People participating in the by burning their shoes because is on s new ad just shows exactly why he kneels.
Burn your Niki shoes etc, let us hope it is the END of the company
To explain what I mean: Kneeling to the anthem is acting in the way the flag allows, and therefore honoring the flag, but it is also dishonoring the flag because you are kneeling instead of standing and honoring the flag. Hence, a paradox.
I'm REAL disappointed today. I don't have ANYTHING in the house that has the Logo on it to burn. I wish I had something from to set on fire. But I've NEVER OWNED anything from . So it's easy for me to Burn YOURS for me. OK? Video it and post it
We all know why you're saying that. Not that you believe in something... if Trump was supporting you would say the exact opposite!
My guess is of those who are doing the at least 1/4 of them burn their New Balance shoes by accident because they have an N on them.
If you support , you're an asshole. Happy Monday.
I believe the vitriol is magnified towards Kaepernick because he is multi racial and raised by adoptive White parents. The fact that he took a stand on the side of what most Black people believe and against the common view of White people was seen as a betrayal
About this business.Dont BURN your stuff, donate it to a homeless shelter (NOT GOODWILL) or a womens shelter, etc. Burning it on camera is BS & makes you look silly.Dont buy their stuff anymore & dont give them any attention!!(Cont)

Because burning your own property to show your disdain for Nike supporting a communist is far worse than burning down your neighborhood and looting other people's property.
So I just recently saw my podiatrist and he referred me to a New Balance store. After the events of this Labor day weekend, I'm going to go against his advice and hit up the store instead.
New Balance who supports America
Will not purchas anymore Nike gear until they come to their senses. Companies need to be careful before aligning themselves to certain causes/agendas.
If only there was a way to get the election administration to strike a deal with and get all supporters to boycott voting.. We could totally

Thats what a boycott is Eric. just do it!!!
To tackle racism are you actually relying on ?! This is just insane and proves how non-sense is where are you going in America! Id have vote for any random kid at Campton instead but I guess that wouldnt make any money

Just do it! doesnt know what sacrificing everything looks like. Liberal assholes.
The bots are out in this trend. Creating division and putting white folks racism on top of all trends when we should be focused on the Supreme Court pick. Mayo MAGA's boycott attempts have all been ineffective.
The face of a butt hurt pu$$y. will see their stock price deteriorate for supporting this piece of crap! I will never buy any Nike products again.

All this discussion bout how great Nike is for having Kap as their face . . . but Nike is just a major corporation who only gives a shit about their money
So yall conservatives and Trump supporters are really burning your Nike stuff like Nike doesnt already have your money?!?!?
they only want millenniums for customers who do not think who needs Nike??
This is absolutely ridiculous lol

Stop using the troops as an excuse to burn your Nike shit. Im not your scapegoat. Im gonna sit over here and continue to buy my Nike stuff, they give military a discount
Instead of burning your Nike gear, how about giving it to me. I know a few homeless people that are way less privileged than you who could use them.

I'm sure it doesn't matter or you'd have rethought this slap in America's face; but just so you know, my wife, my 4 grown athletic kids, and me will never buy another Nike product. Just screw you.

Would be smarter to sell that stuff instead of destroying it TBH. Nike is about consumerism after all, and a second hand market would take a bigger share of their profits than taking those products you've already paid for off the market completely. Just sayin

don't destroy your Nike's just send them to me! Shirt M, shirts L, and shoes 10 men. Thanks!
just because I am no longer purchasing anything Nike does not mean I'm a racist. It means I will respect the National Anthem and the USA flag FOREVER!!!

Can we all watch this though ? Like can his supporters comment on this ? Fucking disgusting.
Oh I forgot, this country was made BY us, but never FOR us smh. That's why y'all really mad!
Patiently waiting to see people waking around like captain caveman cause they dont have any shoes to wear.
"wise" business decisions just like the "ESPN social warriors." Hope Nike sales head in the same direction as ESPN's tanking viewership.
I began boycotting before it was the cool thing to do. Expensive. Nothing special. Made for pennies. Never worn and never will. And their are so obvious it is laughable. All they care about is money.
Cutting the Nike label off their already purchased goods. Oooohhhhh white people. Youre hilarious. And embarrassing.
Us Russian bots prefer Adidas, anyway.
When Barack told us he was born a citizen, y'all called him a liar. When he said he was a Christian y'all called him a liar. NFL players are saying it's not about the military or flag but about police brutality and y'all call them liars.
Sad that the crew is mad at for kneeling for a BS anthem, but not mad about police brutality & Injustice
Im curious why does the left suddenly care about the well being of people all the sudden? To push their agenda
Would people care if Nike made their spokesman a white man who wore socks representing black people as monkeys? Same shit. Its an attack on people. I dont support either!!
you people boycotting are the same morons doing the dance.
Nike is now an anti police org who supports and other anti police orgs
Im so proud of Nike for not being scared of showing us what they believe ! Nike going to get the bag anyways... not going to hurt them !

had he prefaced his kneeling w/talking about the injustices the Veterans go through you'd all go purchase every item you could while yelling 'Merica. Hell,he coulda talked about animal cruelty and y'all wouldn't be losing your shit. What's that say bout you?
supporter: Im supporting the !: Just Do It!
I am a big fan of but this is outrageous regardless of anyones political views! Instead of investing in an up and coming young athlete Nike decided to politicise their products and their company?! Politics and sport dont mix! Full stop.
One damn day into the and the liberals are squealing like stuck pigs! Oh, boo hoo hoo think of the homeless and the children!What about cops and their families & kids? Why cant I support them?
Nike knowing they already got your dollars and just sitting back watching everything burn:
Ppl fr talking about oppression, and the struggle of being black in America...it must be so hard
Ive lost followers from retweeting content and I love it. I dont want yall closet racists on my timeline. Its not about insulting the flag or not supporting troops, miss me with that BS.
When Trump won't let you near the White House, but they hate to lose a darker shaded supporter so they set you up with a paid gig to dance the Bojangles THIS little number is called
As with every other product in the USA Americans will vote with their wallets!Plus Nike just might be post peak...
This is so dumb, you really think ima destroy clothes that is already expensive because they wanna advertise someones beliefs? Nah Im G , You guys do you.
Boycotters... Just do it!
I bought a pair of walking shoes on Friday.... I'm taking them back today to buy Nike because... you know...
People on here saying and "I'm never buying Nike products again" are probably the same people who think runs Twitter or owns KD
If you don't currently own any products you should buy as many as you can afford so that you can burn them and demonstrate your support for the .Personally, it's the sweatshops that turned me off . Odd how that didn't seem to bother these folks.
What is this?? is yhis because Yoon just posted /// ???
The losers just found out owns : it's 2018 we all have the same . How is anybody that confident in their ignorance?It's really gonna be shocking if they google & discovers their Nazi -Germany background...especially ties to the SS. LOL.
With the trending, it seems that creating and exploiting division is becoming the future of marketing and even entertainment, separating the consumer base into tribes, then pitting them against each other. Like an arms dealer, supplying two forces...
Only in the capital of white supremacy, racists and amoral people will boycott a company for supporting a person who boycotted oppression and murder of unarmed Black people.
I usually wear all stars but now I'm going to buy my first pair of Nike sneakers in support...no
Lots of shoes floating down in the sewers today. Must be the humans are amusing. Tasty, too.
Just subvert it.
If anyone is thinking about burning their nike products ill be happy to take them and give them to homeless vets which you republicans claim to support
Guys, we might have huge problems in South Africa but the division between people here don't come close to what is happening in the US. Check out the crazies!
Lol yall were just making fun of liberals for boycotting In-N-Out last week.
If you're a fan of John and Rich and support Kaepernick he wants you to unfollow him. Who the hell is John and Rich anyway??
The gives racist trash an opportunity to display their ugly side. It has noting to do with patriotism, or they would have stormed the White House after President Orangina betrayed his country while embracing Putin.
All the people supporting the want cops to keep shooting black people.Yes, you idiots, it IS that simple.
Just Don't do it!
NOPE! Because this is Nike... Im all in, buying shoes, shorts, shirts and hats yall.
Now I just love my gear more! is a joke
People at , just laughing at the dumb ass people burning their shoes.
Ya'll should be boycotting shoes because of their animal based materials. At least donate the shoes you got and Buy Vegan.
My Nike gear was always useful. Today it became meaningful.
Are yall gonna boycott the NFL too since Nike sponsors their uniforms? Afterall, wouldnt that still be giving Nike your business? Yall call us sensitive but stay burning your shit, going off on social media, and crying about not being able to oppress others.
Show us how mad y'all are. Video yourselves burning one of those $300 authentic Nike jerseys instead of old ratty socks and busted up shoes. Just do it if you're so committed .
Because they are not an American made product and are not American in general. stand with your country stand proud
I do hope that kaepernik getting a job, inspires the folks who admire or respect him, to do the same.
This just in, liberals will be wearing Nike's for their next race.
Yessir! Let's & Ferguson of , NEVER HAPPENED! 6 HONEST witnesses said Mike Brown attacked the Cop. etc
Everyone that is purposely ruining clothing in the is an idiot. You spent how much on those kicks and you're just gonna burn em up and throw them away? Fools. Y'all could at least bring your perfectly worn clothing to donation sites for people that could use it.
I love how this whole was spurred on by a has-been country music act who hasn't been relevant for at least a decade. Just a desperate ploy for easy attention
Pass me them OFF WHITES and Jordans if you're going to support the
both support this bigot . Military vet told Colin to kneel. PLEASE READ
Shout out to all the racists and twats participating in thr . Your families must be so proud
Hey while you geniuses are burning your possessions, don't forget to add Converse and Hurley to the fire. Nike owns them too.
People love burning stuff when things don't go their way. Burned down black Wall Street. Burned crosses on black people's front lawn. Bombed and kilked those 4 little girls all because they didn't like change.
I am glad we have no other problems in this country than to burn up clothes. I am happy that some people take a stand for what they believe in. We could use more of
Told my son who is a disabled recently retired soldier idiots were burning their because of is part of ... His reply:morons burn perfectly good shoes after paying for them sounds like a moron boycott -
They Crucified Jesus
you support the and say you support Veterans, there are organizations like the Veterans Integration Center in Albuquerque NM that are helping homeless Veterans that would love your Nike stuff to sell in their thrift store.
Easy for me to participate in a . I dont buy their brand anyway. Support . At least some of theirs are made in the !
You have no clue. White privilege is a farce, cops are not brutal, and racial injustice is in the eye of the beholder. You think "hands up don't shoot" was real. Yes, and Kneeling players should kneel in the streets of Chicago, Baltimore, LA, .......BRUTAL
Instead of burning shoes and being angry, perhaps support a company that makes shoes in America? I remember when the left burned New Balances since a VP said they look forward to working with Trump.Dont fall for hysterics.
Me headed to the mall to grab a pair of Huaraches in support of Nike. It's Kaepitalism baby.

Trump supporters react to Nike ad campaign starring + launch
Intro-douching the next failed wingnut action: just are not intelligent.
Breaking News!!!! Due to the taking place by butt hurt Trump supporters, is officially planning to file bankruptcy. Seriously i doubt will be hurt by you all choosing to go to . Shit most of you wear Sketchers anyway
Nike decided, Just do it.Trump-lovers said, Youll rue it!But fans who support Real heroes of sport Said, Tell the haters to screw it.
This nonsense is showing much more clearly the naivety in which Americans burrow themselves to rationalize their opinions. Its just sad.
had he prefaced his kneeling w/talking about the injustices the Veterans go through you'd all go purchase every item you could while yelling 'Merica. Hell,he coulda talked about animal cruelty and y'all wouldn't be losing your shit. What's that say bout you?
And just like that, I became a fan.
Yes because burning shoes you already use your money on is showing them who boss
Nike using KAP :
A traitor and an anti-Trump John Brennan teamed up with ex Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to support Colin Kaepernick-because they love it when people disrespect our flag and national anthem
this is why the aliens decided to skip interacting with us
Yall seen the new meme narrative? aint even been in the military and they talkin bout Pat Tillman. They gotta use past on warriors. Like we didnt know you idolize something you could never do. Dont make a meme chump, Join the military.
Yall boycotters should just light yourselves on fire.
Just bought some new shoes and proud to be in the New Balance family. 10+ year user of gone for good.
Very amusing the way the bigots in America boycotting Nike think its gonna kill the company as if Nike apparel is not bought & sold all over the world.
Everybody mad about becoming the face of NIKE. But not the fact that is the face of America? Im confused!!
When did Trump supporters become so concerned with the working conditions of Nike workers in the Far East? Good for them.
My response to Nike and John Brennan for supporting a police abuser and to the police abuser and disrespecting the flag via those who fought for our country
Plenty of disrespected homeless Vets and children that could probably use that Nike gear you wanna burn. But you do you, I'm sure Nike is furious aaaaaaand distraught you are burning money.... dumbasses.
Apparently, Nike had too much money on hand and figured alienating half of the country would help to reduce it in a major way. Otherwise, they would have used Pat Tillman in their ad campaign.
...and in one social media post out themselves to what everyone else had only suspected; they are holding on to racist ideology and support systemic racism.
If goes to trial in his collusion case vs , it will be a precedent-setting decision. numbskulls doing a are going to have strokes when they see the league pay out tens of millions of dollars that will go to fund grassroots social justice orgs.
I still dont know what throwing away or destroying inanimate objects achieve except a useless hefty credit card bill.
If you are currently cutting up your clothes in an effort to boycott Nike for throwing support behind a black athlete who wants fairness, equality, and justice for all... you might be a racist.
As far as the goes, I don't wear them anyway because I find them overpriced and uncomfortable, but please donate them rather than burn them. That would smell so bad. Some uber-patriotic American made startup shoe company will benefit greatly from this.
One thing that so funny about this is that assumes the United States is the center of the world... is a global company. and all have Nike Kits for instance. Their stock is gonna be just fine. Lol
Nike, do you really mean just "something?" Because it could mean "anything."
Yet police brutality is ok towards people of color or any other race. You clearly dont understand the real reason why was kneeling. The United States needs to change how they do things. BoyCott these I will continue to wear nike!
I'm poor as hell & is expensive......all of y'all boycotting can just send me ur gear, I'll gladly take it off ur hands!
I know this isnt the larger issue, but Im pretty sure Nike will be just fine after the . When is the last time you saw anyone in a MAGA hat at the gym?
If youre boycotting Nike than look at the school that you root for and understand you probably have to boycott them too because theyre probably sponsored by Nike too. Should be a lot of empty seats at Alabama games and other places if theyre not hypocrites.
Nike is using black people and liberals to make more money for their white owners and China. It's all about money and kapernick is the biggest sell out to all Americans
If hiring a guy who did what the US was founded on is what made people turn away from a billion$ company, and not the fact they use inhumane labor practices, do I really want to live on this planet anymore?
Just think of Colin Kaepernick depositing that big fat Nike check. How many MAGA hats would that cover?
if youre burning or throwing away something youve already paid for? Ahaha youre taking your stupidity to the highest level. Only trump supporters, dumebest people on earth.
Most people trying to don't wear them anyway nike will be just fine
I'm not boycotting Nike because of their support of a racist Anti-American like Kaepernick I just don't support them because their products are shitty, cheap made crap
Thats on my list of things to do Friday RT : I should go buy a pair a vapes just for the
If anyone is thinking of burning any size eleven Jordan 12s or 13s, please DM me first. Just ship them to me for safe disposal.
If You Support The You are simply out of touch
. Liberal Logic: Getting millions of dollars from an endorsement deal is sacrificing everything. And Nike who treats workers as slaves in sweatshops in Asia is doing its part for Social Justice God, Liberals are such vile ignorant creeps
With all these Trump-assclowns supporting the I'm reminded of another boycott by these same kinds of people wonder what it feels like to always be on the wrong side of history?
Makes me even happier that is switching to Adidas. First to not continue supporting P Knight Farm Team... Now today's News...
Funny how social justice warriors are more upset about people burning thier nikes, but applaud people who burn thier own neighborhoods down.
Trumpers accuse Liberals of being easy to trigger yet notice how many boycotts they start because people have different opinions.
The people saying are the ones who haven't bought a new pair of shoes in 10 years. They're not going to miss your dusty dollars
Socks, huh?How about life & dignity for:Tamir Rice Eric GarnerSterling BrownWalter ScottAlton SterlingTerence CrutcherPhilando Castileor any black person getting the police called on them for just living their lives in this racially hostile time of Trump?
"How to Boycott" by Trumpsters1) Purchase item w/your own money2) Destroy item you purchased3) Post a picture of you destroying this item4) Purchase same item from a different companySpend double. Original company already has your money. Fiscal responsibility...
My family has always wanted Nike shoes and gear for back to school. Thought it was odd that they wanted and this year. . We stand and respect our flag, soldiers, veterans and America. Nike will never get another penny from us!
highlights one thing to me. The world is full of idiots, burning products you have already paid for is beyond ridiculous and doing so because you don't like a company endorsing an ideal that is peaceful and for change is as clever as stirring hot tea with you d**k.
Hey Nike! If your truly about social justice, then bring your manufacturing jobs to the USA.
How does someone standing for social injustice create vulgar thoughts and feelings amongst others
I am so upset with my Dems because the Repubs wouldn't even hear or see Merrick Garland but they are willing to sit, see & hear info on
I'm convinced that this country is full of lowkey pyromaniacs because y'all love finding the dumbest reasons to burn stuff
When MAGA fans realize that Phil Knight is an Army veteran so is boycotting a Veteran-Owned Business
Imagine if all the Americans that are currently 'Raising awareness' or 'boycotting' would just decide to do something productive to make this country better. America would be pretty freakin awesome.
liberals bagging on people to give their Nike products to homeless Veterans are lacking when they previously whined over illegals when homelessness and hunger even exists among our Veterans.
Balance Made in USA Supported Donald Trump!!'Nuf Said.
If you really wanted to join the ... why not just short $NKE? That $81.50 drop off was undeniable pre-market
Let's make this quickier: Does Nike still use sweatshops AND child labor? Does Kaepernick endorse this?
Just made a song about the go listen on SPOTIFY ITUNES STORE 99 cents cloud
Just watch the video ŒºŒ≠œÉœâ œÑŒøœÖ œáœÅŒÆœÉœÑŒ∑
You know whos winning in this bullshit......former Nike CEO Phil Knight. You know whos losing.... Trump supporters, fall and winter are coming you need shoes and clothes to stay warm.
I just did it.
because of numb nuts.
Just here to watch the Nike dumpster fire...
Hey just shot themselves in the foot!
If your going to burn your gear, at least give to the homeless or the needy. Just think if we spent as much energy boycotting, change course and work nothings that matter, instead of these companies that are not very smart with their marketing.
That means is "Bigly" The racusts hate to see black folks make progress. Don't me b/c I ultimately don't GAF about your opinion of mine. the haters Do something purposeful with your miserable pathetic bigoted lives. . swoosh
If youre destroying your Nike stuff b/c is in their newest ad, then thats just your money down the drain, so its really your loss. You shouldnt boycott a company b/c they have a man whos been fighting for equality in their ad. Thats just stupid.
The is meaningless to yours truly, whose workout gear is primarily sourced from and , the latter a favorite of my father's since long before I was born. In other words, the boycotters' and supporters' grievances mean nothing to me. (3/3)
No. 1 trend on Twitter is .Is Nike earning love from much of market it already serves & distancing itself from many potential future buyers?Fascinating mix of sport, business & politics.
So all of you idiots want to now? Where were you when kids were (and still are) killing each other over shoes and does nothing, but sell more $500 dollar footwear. Just kiss my ass.
Trump supporters who obsess on the are playing a ZERO SUM game like they have with every faddish boycott in the past. They should instead focus on , & instead. That's what loyal voters EXPECT Republicans to talk about. (1/3)
Wait Im confused - this is because people are butthurt about Nike signing someone who cares about racial injustice? Yall wild. Take a seat.
This whole ad concept is now blurring across racial boundaries....just read the Tweets Thank you for stoking the fires of racism.
dont weary bout these racist fucks we dont want them to wear Nike cuz its for good people with a good heartbeat not a rapid racist heartbeat, burn on they use to that burning shit like the cross
Anyone who thinks only white people support our LEOs is just plain ignorant.
I love America, but I own like 5 sets of Nikes..so..Ill be wearing them..until they break..cause Im not an idiot who wastes money lol. Go sell them or go give them to a homeless person.
Ill be buying as much as I can. Great move on their part using in their ad campaign. For those ppl destroying their products, how about donating them to a worthy cause instead?
If you're so woke...why don't you know your Nikes were glued together by a grandmother in hunched over a machine in Vietnam? She got $.34 that day. Barely enough to buy meal. But sure...go on with your support of a shitty company for paying a fraud money for an ad
The last Nikes I owned. Didnt wear them to school because grunge rock was becoming a thing.

PSAIf anyone reading this is gonna destroy their Nike gear, send it to me instead. Plenty of homeless people could use it and I'll get it to them. Thanks in advance.
To everyone burning or cutting up their nike clothes for the if ur a shoe size between 12-13 just give them to me if you dont want them
Because Nike supports Colin Kaepernick, conservatives are now burning sneakers instead of crosses. ~ Chad
dont have to destroy their cloths / sneakers, just dont buy Nike products going forward.
Its not a black and white thing its about disrespect and having a victim mentality. Black people have been asked to produce evidence that they are still oppressed and you come back with how prosperous black people are.
Your post suggests is working and the is working because of those Deplorables. Well.
Just Blew It
Ive come to the conclusion that the only time certain people only care about our military, is when it deals with the kneeling controversy. Otherwise, they wont do anything. Your ‚Äòsupport is a bunch of BS. Actions speaks louder than words. This is just stupid.
hey everyone shut up and let me use my shoes
Go to any US military installation across the country during PT hours and youll see troops wearing Nike more than any other sneaker...these are the people that you clowns are burning sneakers for..Our service men & women have a lot more to worry about than a stupid
The is so stupid from the economy view here you have couple of million people vs. the market of 45 countries outside that total market triple the size of the United States. In this countries is consider a GOD.. try to influence that
Just think if all of these ppl destroying Nike stuff just donated them to those that actually need them
I can't . can't boycott something you never buy we have never been a Nike family in my plus 50 years on this Earth it's Adidas all the way
When racist think their is going to really do serious damage to the largest athletic wear brand on planet earth
These people are a special kinda stupid... Same as the boycotters...
While the is hilariously stupid, please don't run out and buy Nike as some kind of counter point. They're still a monstrous company who you absolutely should not financially support, Kaepernick or no. Take a few minutes to research their treatment of factory workers.
finally found out what is good at!RUINING EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES!Good luck w/ THAT business model!
Great Day for local shoe merchants and Footlocker (except you Jordan horders). If you can, go buy a pair of shoes and donate one. If not get a t-shirt or just sport a swoosh
Kaepernick supported by communist supporter, John Brennan, what a surpirse. Nothing like a Brennan endorsement to help sports shoe sales! LOL.
I just unfollowed someone for saying they were going to buy Nike now.I don't need that level of ignorance on my timeline.
challenge. You might not want YOUR Nike socks/shoes/pants/tshirts, but there's a veteran out there who needs them. If you destroy your Nike-wear for a "cause", then at least for every socks/shoes/pants/t's you replace, also buy a set for a homeless veteran.
You Americans are fucking pathetic. Bitch and complain about EVERYTHING. Why don't you watch children die because the NRA and president support guns. fucking fat overweight retards.
I have worn ever since Marine Basic made us where during training. Not no more
The fact that is trending on Twitter is disgusting. Keep it up !!!!
Just don't buy Nike
FACT: 7 out of every 10 Trump supporters will be too stupid to remove their Nike shoes before lighting them on fire.
Silly me. I thought he was just a mediocre QB so his antics werent worth putting up with
Just bought new ones!
Oh now you do the but not because of sweat shops and child labor issues
is trending because of everyone tweeting how dumb the idea is

Same ppl talking bout be same ones wearing the 30$ Marshall Nikes
there will be no nike in my household. Giving endorsement contracts to a vile racist like not about talking about inequality about "cops fry them like bacon" standing for a dangerous ideology not their customers
Instead of destroying clothing over the , why not donate the stuff instead? Or is decency just not in your character?
Torn. On the one hand I like because their business model is one of sweatshops and unchecked capitalism to the detriment of everyone, and on the other, fuck Trump and the carnival of cement-brained racist dolts who hate Kaepernick for standing up to systemic racism.
So youre mad at Nike, but not at Police brutality & injustice for black people?
is coming from the same people who didnt have a problem with the TRAITOR in the Oval Office that stood in front of the world and BETRAYED America.
Im with . Just saw the one and am going to let my partner know about this. No more buying Adidas. As for this : typical racist white folks who need a reality check thinking something like this will make a difference. Like their Starbucks boycotts...
Good! this is America & we support R Heroes
is hilarious. If a white football player to bring more attention to "illegal immigration" - there would already be a statue resurrected in his name & Trump would hire him.
I would take part in the but frankly I haven't bought any of their products in years. Mizuno, Asics, and New Balance all have a much better product at a same/similar price point.
The retards burning there Nikes are just that retarded. Or you could of done the sensible thing and donated your nike products to homeless shelters. Fucking retards.
If youre burning Nikes in the 1st place:1. Nike has already profited off of said purchase you are destroying and youre an idiot.2. Your attempt at masking your racism with patriotism is both obvious and transparent...
Setting fire to your own feet is the perfect analogy for the situation that the USA has created for itself.
I'm thinking about buying an extra pair of Nike running shoes. Just to balance out one racist somewhere in America.
roflmao proves without a doubt, he is just a criminal radical Communist, Barack Obama put in charge of our CIA - well done Brennan, well done.
I dont think people understand what boycott means. Its not destroying something youve already paid for (which already supported the company). Its not buying anything from them moving forward.
If people are so mad at Nike that they will burn their shoes and , just wait until someone tells them about what the president has said about POWs and Gold Star families.
Just did it...Now, let the market do the talking.
I will buy Nike!! 58 year old white woman who loves my country. Sick of old billionaires running our country.
Imagine if Trump supporters didn't get triggered by every little thing a company does. They're so weak.
Colin Kaepernick?! I will now be taking my business elsewhere!
I will now be supporting the movement in fear that yt boys will overwhelmingly return to there satanic tradition of not wearing socks with converse and boat shoes. I refuse to subject my nose to that type torture again so please respect my decision. Thank you!
my years of loyalty to your brand are over. It's time to 'JUST DO IT' and move on to a company that does not endorse a despicable anti-American, whiny, ex-football player that lost his job because he sucks. He hasn't sacrificed anything.
out of the people openly participating in a " " , can't help to think of those behind closed doors equally pissed, just not voicing it publicly.
or notBut inserted itself into political discourse.Commercial enterprise is using political discourse for marketing while alienating half of the voters.
A word about : This constant shaking of cultural fault lines was prophesied by Jesus Christ at Matthew 24, indicating that the Lord is indeed coming.
Wait, people are really about to boycott nike?? I would bet money these boycotters will be saying they supported Kaep 30 years from now like people claim they supported and matched with MLK.
When you support a piece of human filth that refuses to hold Putin accountable for his attack on America, insults Gold Star families and demeans a war heros service to our country, you dont get to voice your phony patriotic outrage.Fuck off!
If you're destroying Nike products you already own, you're accomplishing nothing. They already got your money. Seriously, just donate it.
George Straits Fifth No. 1 Hit Lets Fall To Pieces Together
Oh, it's time to buy new sneakers again? No problem. I need new ones and always stand with the people who fight for equality and fair treatment.I'd much rather boycott corporations that support Trump and Fox News.
Can we all just admit that took a knee out of an existential identity crisis? really?
I don't care if John Brennan supports Kaepernick. Both are losers. Frankly, I'd rather not see his pathetic face on my TL.Go ahead & is about to gain a 2nd & the Left is losing its
If you have money invested in $NKE just take it all out.
Just fucking listen to the song .. morons
the worst business boycott is grassroots and no central leader, the best boycott is when a , or leader call for it.
Since so many of you suddenly "hate" your favorite Air Max why not box them up along with all of your apparel and donate them to a local shelter? Those who are abused or homeless would greatly appreciate your items.
They are doubly owning the libs, because they are getting lung cancer from inhaling burning rubber and won't use Obama care to get treatment!
I don't know who Big & Rich is & don't give 2 damns. Fact is, I don't even wear 's however, since privileged racist's heads are exploding all over privileged racist America, I'm about to buy my first pair of . I support . Miss me w/your .
Nike aint tripping off people burning they clothes and shoes cause they already bought them and hell black people stop buying Tommy Hilf long time ago.
Eliminating Police violence against African-American is one issue. Respecting the US symbols, the flag and the national anthem, is another issue. Each can be dealt separately, with big suscess. Kaepernick to be face of new Nike ad campaign.
Glad to see trending at but its all for not. Im sure completed an analysis (age groups/ethnic groups) to identify its base support and guess what yall, it aint Trump supporters. That said, its kind of hard to boycott something you were never buying.
I guess the people didnt see the coverage on InandOut Burger or The Red Hen. No more Nike for this household.
What these hillbillies don't understand is that is global brand... global as in other countries around the world. As in there are other countries than the US that exist. I only hope follow suit so you morons can then starve to death.
What difference does it make to our daily lives if kap is the face of .They want us to believe we are each others enemy.
So do you not want to donate your gear to people in need because you have lice and roaches?
The same scary ass , pussy ass white folks who aint gone do shit the only ones I see with the
I'm certainly not burning any stuff, heck I bought it...I just know that I'm not buying any more moving forward, sorry kids.
how about yall boycott something worth boycotting. Theres fortunately not enough of you ignorant people to put Nike out of business. You burning/cutting up Nike items that you purchased with your own money is the real joke here
Real quick, if youre burning your please just give them to people who need them. The homeless need socks & shoes. Also many are vets so if this really isnt about you being racist & its just you being ignorant then give to your local shelters
Usually a Converse guy but I might just pick up some Nike gear when I get paid.
Um, has been a spokesperson since 2011, and yall have been wearing their duds this whole time. and the rest of you morons need to use some of your new sock money to buy yourselves a clue.
Not for nothing, but is trending above . Possibly because people cant spell Kaepernick. But you cant deny that Nike has alienated a significant portion of its customer base. Not just old people buying golf balls.
Scrolling down the page I found 50 tweet making fun of the boycott, and 9 tweets actually doing it. These people are in the minority, just fucking ignore them and let them act stupid.
On I do not own any but I used to buy many things for my kids & THATS OVER!!
Why are Trump supporters boycotts always so stupid? Its the Kerig coffee makers all over again.
I think I need to pick up some gear today. ( ridiculous )
If you dont want your . stuff Dont cut it up or Burn it... just Mail it ME!Ill WEAR it for YOU!!!
wont be burning any merch, because I never owned any. Nike gear is crap. I will keep running in my mizunos every day. I never buy Nike crap.

The same people doin because Kaepernick is unpatriotic were the same people shitting on a POW during his FUNERAL SERVICES.
Its also crazy that your burning your own clothes now lol cause tbh once its leaves the stores its yours now lol so ik some of the ppl who are burning there shit look dumb
Just went out and bought myself a pair of these that I'll never wear to own the libs, look at the not so subtle BLACK ON TOP OF WHITE colour scheme. If that isn't a blatant call to WHITE GENOCIDE then Donald Trump has a MASSIVE pair of hands!
SINCE YALL WANNA BOYCOTT SO MUCH INSTEAD OF BURNING THE GEAR DONATE IT TO THE HOMELESS VETS U SAY U SUPPORT
Nike slides after tapping Colin Kaepernick as the new face of its 'Just Do It' ads (NKE) -
Funny how some "ultra rednecks masquerading as patriots in their ignorant minds" ,can do just anything dumb to claim some social media glory instead of donating those items to the true patriots war vets that fought for them..
THIS JUST IN: There's more to the American flag than just the military.
This just in Nike has been diagnosed with Colin Cancer, results sure to include dramatic loss of revenues.
The is futile, but those saying only racists support it is typical oppressive.
most of y'all angry white folks participating on this y'all got ZERO IQjust like this bitch down here ..
Pathetic people would damage their own possessions for this bullshit are like a bunch of hemorrhoids. Remove one & the others migrate.Irritating, painful but basically just full of shit
Just figured out what to get those hard to shop for, Trump supporting relatives for the holidays, Nike gift cards.
Instead of destroy still usefull goods how about donating them
This is hilarious. This guy doesn't even know what he's upset about, obviously, and goes and burns his own shoes!
I can't stand over privileged puke. But, it's funny with these dumbass boycotts like and everyone burning their shit these companies don't care about you. It ain't going run them out of business. Lol.
CK offended 850,000 cops and loved ones across USA. Nike can do socks too.
Nike's business will be just fine because ppl will buy the merch to wear or burn it; either way it will be bought. A win win situation for &
shows me that racism in America is still a major problem. Its not just a Down South issue either. We have to do better America.
I just woke up to white people burning their shit--like they don't do that anyway i mean
Nike getting coins off Black Athletes whether you like it or not. They take this stance on the issue because they see our greatness, potential and strength. Nobody deserves to be murdered in the streets like animals just because the color of their skin.
Trump supporters made my gym smell like dirty butt
Virtue signaling and mixing politics with business has consequences
House catches fire. 911. Fireman bust down front door, break things. Extinguish fire saving u $$$. They determine cause, iron u left on. U r upset they damaged stuff to save house & threaten to sue city. Racists whites refuse to focus on real issue. Burn baby burn.
Be amusing if he had to get down on one knee to do this.
I'm going 2 assume there's going 2 b long lines of DAFTs barefoot in front of preaching their bs as they thump on their Bibles this ...Yeah that's what I thought. Tomorrow will b another opportunity 2 show their ignorance.
The Man in Black Left us an Important Reminder
Anyone getting rid of their Nike stuff in Ohio Ill just take it off your hands size small to medium thanks
Uneducated Trump supporters are too dumb to realize that boycotting Nike in hate will only increase their revenue.
Yall better make sure yall kids stop buying to and turn of those bots let's us sneakers head get some off these and etc
Ray Charles I Cant Stop Loving You was a Tremendous Hit
Im all for just because I love adidas
Its not Anti-American, Anti-Anthem, Anti-Veteran, Anti-Flag or Anti-Police. Its Pro People Of Color American Life. Its about systemic oppression of POC. Its about Equal Justice under the Law.
Thank you for inspiring me to participate in the just to prove you wrong.
I dont currently own any but I will be rectifying that... Thank you to for supporting all athletes
It's great when the left rushes out to spend all their money on overpriced sweat shop shoes during campaign season.Keep on the down low. Tell every Democrat tool you know to buy six pairs.
So, if made the face of today would gamers the world over burn their ? Keep in mind drops this week is just another way to cloud the real message. Do better, .
Using a military vet rather than Colin is a much better idea.
If your going to Do it because of their Slave wages.And are made over seas. And are making their sneakers out of their own garbage and selling them for 160+. Boycott that !
I love that conservatives are losing their sh*t over this.I'm hoping this sends Orange Julius Caesar over the edge.
Uhm people do know that this is just advertising & its showing all the hate people have against people grow the hell up!
Conservatives burning/destroying their apparel is HILARIOUS.
A Chat that Became a Hit, Is It Raining at Your House by Vern Gosdin
Not going to happen. Today I am going to wear my Nike Monarchs. If I see a supporter then I'l raise my foot and point to my Nike.
I usually stay away from politics BUT since we're here doesn't need your money cause they have mine.
Trump Evangelicals demand their flocks listen & obey Donald mindlessly. Sadly, opposing issues like this compromises ALL Christian credibility & for what? NFL players spotlighting Injustice by kneeling for seconds? stupid!Go ColinGo PlayersGo Nike
So takes a stand (or knee) career gets crucified, MLK takes a stand gets assassinated, Gandhi, takes a stand gets assassinated, Jesus takes a stand for the poor and helpless, gets crucified(literally)...Im starting to see the trend here...
at all your posts on Twitter, it's clear to see YOU are about the Black race and NOT Whites. Do the math; 13% Blacks in US. Small percentage that buy your products. Worth stabbing America in the back?
Human Beings in America are more furious w/ Football Players for kneeling in an open field during a bullshit song for a moment than they are w/ Priests & Bishops for raping & abusing children & women in closets & cathedrals for centuries & hiding it
Tucker Carlson said it best. The elite of big corporations hate the same people (YOU) that bought their products and made them rich in the first place. Nike knows full well what the controversy around Kaepernick stands for.
I think its hilarious that everyone is giving Kapernick so much credit. He didnt start anything, he was benched cause he sucked! He came up with an answer when asked why he was sitting. Stupid decision
burning products that youve already bought is just stupid- but i mean do you boo, nike alr got they money from you
I've done a lot of stupid things in my life but, I've never burned shoes and clothing I've already bought because I am upset that there are people who don't want to be unjustly discriminated and brutalized by law enforcement.
For what it is worth, I just purchased my first item ever from Nike.....Golf Shoes!
Good job Bru? Buying an entire store stock of Nike products and burning it to puss off Luberals is a brilliant idea.
Nike founder Phil Knight retired from Nike, donated $500,000 to candidate for governor, and the leftovers at Nike decide to go full . Wow! Hopefully Nike enjoys the same success as Kaepernick has a Q-back in NFL.
Good thing is happening. Now they can face the same fate as Hamilton, Starbucks, & Keurig.
:NIKE, have NO fear of a conservative/racist boycott. GOD is with you. GOD knows what He is doing. Trust me. GOD is going to bless NIKE "abundantly". God's will SHALL be done. God bless NIKE. God bless Colin Kaepernick.
yall giving out discounts for loved customers? I am not boycotting I find it entertaining
JUST SWISH to
You are at a conundrum. You took an oath to support and defend the United States, yet you you think " disrespecting the flag and our National Anthem" by supporting a person who seeks to divide us and unfairly popularizes the myth that police are racist is okay.
stand with your country stand proud
. Hey anti-Trump Nike supporters. Nike has a great sale going on at their locations in Russia.
Another day, another stupid boycott. This time it's the conservatives with . Like Jesus, how little of a life that you have where you get shook over meaningless ad? To the anti- people, how little of a life do Y'ALL have for arguing with no life losers?
If youre in the party worried about children being separated from their parents at the border, and you support a company like Nike whos virtue signaling by selling shoes made by exploited people, children, then I have a bridge to sell you made entirely by women.
NO Trump wants scotus bc said GOP s/d b exempt from civil suits,criminal investigation &criminal prosecutions &Trump needs protection from all these. GOP skanks hiding papers & obstructed merrick garland

Ohhh, the oppression, it must be horrific to endure.
Hi Please let us know when your new line of Pig Socks will be available.
Omg its been 14 hours since tweeted Is he still sleeping since the story broke, or has his head just exploded Or is he too busy making Stephen burn all his Nike stuff?
I imagine once the big guys at Nike seen trending they said "Oh crap" but once they clicked on it and read what people where saying they where like "phew!"... That's how I was . Samething with the dude cutting up his socks.
100% anyone whos supporting the isnt a vet or doesnt know one. and hasnt done anything to help disabled/homeless vets. until yall stop blasting fireworks on veterans day and 4th of July, politely fuck off.
I believe in justice & if me believing in Justice means losing friends & family along the way then farewell to them
Trump voters are so stupid they forgot Nike has been with KP Since 2011 why the boycott now?because they are sheeps who cant do a simple research.
Make Racism Wrong AgainMake Police Abuse Wrong Again
I thought you Support and Love Veterans? Instead of destroying your shoes, DM me for my address. Prove your support for Veterans.
Rather than trying to or senselessly destroying something youve already paid for, you humans should donate those things. There are felines all over the country who would love a pair of socks or shoes to play with. Or, you know, homeless veterans. Just saying.
So, the same people who were having a fit about a war hero's funeral just last week are now so patriotic that they're burning their shoes because of an ad campaign (even though kneeling is really about racial injustice, not the military)? What?
awwweeeee the cult followers are offended by NIKE! Too bad you don't know what winning means! Maybe Buster Browns is more fitting for you!
Womp Womp. Nike will be just fine, worry about something more important
who doing that?? They support and . I'm encouraged spend more money with them.
Im good with support for Colin Kaepernick - its about time the industry that grew off the sweat of athletes took a stand - as a consumer, with household of ten athletes, I will buy your products and boycott those entities who oppose
Nike is well known for using child labour. Doesn't surprise me they hire someone thats anti-American and against law enforcement. Besides Kapernick has refused NFL offers so he could remain a victim. Sad.
Nice try Nike. The slight bump in sales you will get from this decision will pale as compared to the losses you will suffer. Just ask the NFL... just screw it
The same people that wanna boycott Nike are the same ones that boycotted Yeti. Yeti doing just fine. Nike bout to make another 30 BILLION.
This absurd reminds me of when MAGAts were breaking their Keurigs. And they call us snowflakes.
Recent events show that black people (and other ethnic minorities) are being targeted and abused by law enforcement and members of the public for now other reason than the colour of their skin. but please, do tell me more about how Kaepernick is being "Disrespectful"
Maybe that was Colins plan, sabotage a company that abuses children!
??? Because of an endorsement.. not because they're made by Vietnamese child labor...
Instead of destroying, throwing away or burning your Nike products because you're "outraged," donate them to a homeless shelter. There are people there who could use them.
Has Nike apologized for equating the sacrifice of a multimillionaire to the those who truly sacrificed everything, the US military?
Never Again Nike!! Disgusting, Ugly Shoe Salesman!! Better if Al Bundy! &
Im not going to wear my Nikes today... but only because they have mud on them, so after I clean them up I can share my support with and not be dumb by burning shoes when countless people would benefit from them being donated.
You know, if you people supporting the would donate those shoes and clothes to charities that help homeless veterans, maybe you would have a leg to stand on when you browbeat about patriotism.
it's amazing how so many people are focused on a money making decision of a corporation but not the society making decisions of their government...
Blacks are killing each other every day in every major city in America. What is Colin Kaepernick doing to appeal to these people. Its so much better to blame our great law enforcement.
You dont think our Country still has a racially charged undercurrent? Youre obviously out of touch with reality, racism still exists Joe, and its ignorant to think otherwise.
I assure you that the outcry would be the same if they chose Rosie O'Donnell as their face
This whole thing is hilarious. People find a reason to be hateful.
So question for the people involved with Does this mean that youre ok with innocent Blacks being gunned down in the street? Thats a serious question I would love to hear one of you alls input
Burning your shoes doesn't support the military, Trump supporters. It just shows your racism and stupidity. Really want to ? Donate those shoes to those less fortunate than you. People out there, veterans included, who could really use them.
StarbucksStar WarsHamilton HawaiiKeurig...and now, ?If you morons cared as much about Veterans as you pretend to, why not DONATE those Nikes to needy Vets instead of destroying them?Y'all just like burning stuff, don't you?
Just putting it out there you should of been boycotting them before Colin K guy because of their business practices. I mean they have kid SLAVES making their products but whatever im just saying.
Finally, huge props to for his incredible fortitude & willingness to take the flack for being much bigger person than those who oppose him. Id happily take him as the third QB on the with Brees & Bridgewater.Let the abuse commence.
Huge props to for using their platform as a global leader in their respective market to be a non-conformist and recognise that some issues are bigger on the surface and are worth raising awareness about as opposed to manipulating for marketability.
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT:Kneeling for the national anthem is disrespectful to our military and veterans. But cursing out, bashing, and being flat out assholes to veterans who still support Nike is....you showing you loving support for veterans, of course
My husband said he didn't care anymore for a certain brand but will NO Longer be better be careful my 9 year old grandson will only ware he buy him 12 outfits a year not counting all the outfits his parents by him and his uncle,lot of sales
Swoosh..... 4B gone like that! Never provoke the wrath of half your customers. Stupidity shouldn't be rewarded in life or business. I nominate $NKE for the Darwin Award this Fall.
Keep in mind folks that those ppl burning their shoes & cutting their socks are the same ppl that elevated Honey Boo Boo to celebrity status.
Tell me how this got me into a history debate about how Jesus could be black
more buffoonery from the Chief Orange Buffoon and his clot of ignorant pustules.
Here's another one should have used. P.S. Fire your advertising dept.
Just like you Brennan, Collin screwed up by using his place of work to make a political statement. And because fans (the public) are the customer, and he hurt the business, he was fired... just like you.
Nike is a billion dollar corporation that pays good money for market research and analysis. Just like all the companies that chose to piss off Trumpkins. It means that they don't give a damn about Trumpkin tears. They saw benefit in this. Trumpkins are small.
Lmao watching all the fake support for Colin Kapernick is hilarious. You people really are a bunch of fucking sheep!
Is that why is trending number 1 on twitter also such a role model for the community again that's why it's crickets from him when it doesn't fit his bullshit narrativeI do agree he's known for his bullshit activism then his football career because he sucked at that
Seriously? Now I'm going to have to buy a Nike product? okay, I'll buy one and donate it to our local homeless shelter.
No doubt police die in the line of duty due to violence in violation of the law. They sign up for the job. We're not mourning 's career, we're mourning the unarmed men killed by police due to unrestrained use of lethal force
Nike was my favorite athletic brand. The ONLY tennis shoe I have ever worn. Not now, I will NEVER buy this unpatriotic brand again. I hope your brand goes down the drain, just like Kaepernicks career.
Serious question why yall stay burning shit?
ATTENTION PATRIOTS! is [[[TEMPORARILY]]] [[[OFF]]]PUSH HARD WHILE YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY.LATCH ONTO [NEW EYES]
People are using patriotism to disguise their prejudices against black and brown ppl I see homeless Vets everywhere and the same ppl wouldnt give them a nickel.
MT : White Privilege...Kneeling players of color: "It's about police brutality and racial injustice."Trump: "It's about disrespecting the Military, the flag, and America."You: "It's about whatever Donald Trump says it's about."
Im sure Nike is really crushed that a bunch of racist white people are destroying their products after already spending money to buy them.
If you gonna boycott Nike just do it ima still rock the check regardless
You know, when I get home, I'm just gonna kick back and watch a few of the videos of these ass-hurt snowflakes burn shit they already paid for...AGAIN! Im gonna be all like...
The same hypocrites that have this fake outrage are the same ones who will see a veteran living on the streets and won't do a damn thing for them
If you find yourself caught up in a , just know there is a cliff ahead.
i cannot burn any shoes, because i have none.
I'm not a sneaker person, so I won't be buying any Nike's, however, I have just placed an order for Nike Stock!
I'm not an NFL fan, I'm not athletic, I normally buy Ascics to walk but today I'll be buying gear!! is just nonsense!
Nike stock is down 2.4% already 2day. Thats $250 million gone!!!! YO market cap ‚Äòtook a knee Just Do It.
Homeless vets can use all the help they can get. The donation of smelly, used shoes is not one of them.
Bigots are trying to change the narrative. Kaepernick is kneeling because of police brutality and systematic racism. Not because he hates the flag or vets. This isn't even about vets. If you care about this country, you'd care about men being killed while unarmed.
Neo-communist? Now I think conservatives are just making shit up about him now. Dont worry. Ill be buying on your behalf. Now more than ever.
Woke up to see is trending. I thought someone went and said the n-word... Nah. Just a bunch of people mad they only have New Balances to wear.
Selective outrage from MAGA, Nike has sweatshops uh your president is probably an expert, kneeling is aggressive and disrespectful uh sure it was but making fun of disabled people POWs and telling your supports to beat the shit out of others isnt? hypocrits
I think it's funny that everyone is ripping up their clothing for the because they hired someone who "disrespected" the flag but the thought of giving those clothes to homeless veterans never crossed their mind.
I seriously doubt that Pat Tillman, a real-life American hero, would want his sacrifice used as a political talking point OR an advertising campaign. Just my two cents... via |
what Kaepernick is risking? a few more or less millions of dollars. So hypocritical, unsensitive of The Real Hero is the US soldier in the field, the injured coming home, the miner, the oil workers, the construction worker, the train mechanic, the USPS worker.
Says the same people that support companies that ban conservatives because their messages are "hate speech"
How the hell can one website make the human race seem so misinformed and unintelligent? How about, I don't know, quit being so butthurt over EVERYTHING? Just a thought
Lol PAT TILLMAN WAS MURDERED BY THE SAME PEOPLE BEHIND THE FLAG!!! Told lies about his murder for years!! Why? Good Job THE MILITARY PAYS THE NFL OR NFL WOULD NOT GIVE A DAM!!!!
is gonna make a pretty penny off this add I wonder how much he will give to his cause?
If people actually do this, there will be more size 14s in the store. And pop just gave me 2 gift cards, Im lit.
Now do People of Color that are participating in , tell us their values.
Dear Robert, as a former pro Bball player & current agent, stfu. You are clueless. My AAU affiliates are dumping & the pros I work w/ in FIBA & NBA as well. We dont support making a company who allows a man who wore Cops as pigs socks their spokesman.
folk, did y'all boycott Trump after the when he committed treason?OrWhen he lifted Russian sanctions after admitting they attacked us?OrWhen you found out he met w/ Russians to rig the election?OrThe 1500 times he's been caught lying?Nah?
I got to say this. Y'all that don't support y'all with everything he stands against.. But this Wat I don't get wit the people of destroying there Nike Shyt.. That ain't hurting nobody but u.. U spent money on that. U losing out not Y'all crazy
And if you're no longer supporting Nike for standing with Kap, Puma and Adidas also wanted to sign him as well.You ain't gonna wear them either? Your shoe game about to be hella FILA then.
Being an Ad Man must be an easy job, if Nike doesn't completely go in the toilet on this one. WTF? Was Kim Jong Un unavailable?
Just to throw more gas on the fire, I would be interested to see what is paying compared to actual athletes competing on teams with contracts. I bet Nike got one hell of a bargain.
POST: On & their campaign. "Across America, red-faced blowhards spew venom while chucking their Nike kicks onto barbecues. But, at Nike HQs just outside Portland, Im betting all that burnt rubber smells like victory."
Look at all these people who support our troops and especially homeless veterans by burning stuff rather than donating it. The could help but theyre too selfish to care about others and want to throw backyard tantrums with a gas can and a match.

Let me make a trump supporter mad
Wow cant believe supports Colin Kirkpatrick
Nike gonna save us from oppression.
This warms my soul. No modicum of irony with these idiots who voted a man into office who mocked a respected POW and disrespected a Gold Star family. But damn if these pale tears arent delicious!!
I will NEVER buy another product. Ever.A company that supports those spoiled thug millionaires who disrespect our Flag and our National Anthem doesn't deserve my business!
Can't wait to see how all these 'patriotic' Americans react when they find out that their President conspired with Russia to illegally influence the election.
When was the last time a boycott did anything but increase brand exposure & generate more sales from those pushing back on the boycott?
Haha people with this are fucking ridiculous. I can at least appreciate the fact that they're indirectly boycotting child labor and sweatshops so hey guess they're not completely dumb?
NEW GAME ALERT Keep an eye out for anyone burning Nike-brand USA gear. We have to catch it and not let it go unseen.
y'all already paid for the Nike clothing so y'all burning it is only promoting more sells because the clothes can't be donated.
It's great when the left rushes out to spend all their money on overpriced sweat shop shoes during campaign season.Keep on the down low. Tell every Democrat you know to buy six pairs.
Picked these up just in time to wear for the fun new I love America more than you do boycott. But I think I might be doing this wrong... is dumb AF.
I said it before & Ill say it again I dont care what people think but youre not gonna speak for all veterans & say that I feel disrespected because of a flag is disrespected. I dont do what I do for a flag. I do it for the kids
All of these people who are destroying their stuff over an ad campaign are dumb. You already paid for the products, so youre just destroying something you could have given to someone who needs it. The is just people who wanna be angry trying to get attention.
Yeah, because kids give a shit what the older generation is bitching about when they buy shoes! Nice try though!
If you're burning gear because of the ; 1. You're an idiot. 2. Send me your 9.5 lol. But for real, don't burn instead donate the items for those that are in need!
Did you use your IPhone to make this tweet? Because ummm Ive got some news for you high speed.
Wore Nikes to work today just because lol
Nike dont give a shit what you do with the stuff you already bought because you already put your money in their pocket.
First I give up football now Im giving up those who served and kept us safe mean more.
Nike decides to bet on Colin Kaepernick in a historic ad campaign. For many, Nike Just blew it.
WILL NEVER PURCHASE CLOTHES... TOO GHETTO AND SUPPORTING RACISM! REALLY CLASSLESS...
People will burn their Nike shoes and socks, that THEY spent money on already, saying that they care about are military families, but will turn a blind eye to a homeless veteran on the street. Stop confusing your racism and hypocrisy for patriotism.
I can't even remember all the brands Trumpers have boycotted that are going just fine. am I forgetting?
All we asked is that youd be this mad at police brutality and racial injustice.
The same people that are boycotting Nike for their endorsement are the same people that are absolutely fine with leaders of neo-nazi and white supremacist groups endorsing the president.
Just ordered 30 pairs of Nikes for the entire office :)
Everyone against the , show your pride. Finally, a company who wants to support all Americans.
Mixing your personal views with business, especially with conglomerates such as the NFL and Nike, just doesnt work, and it hasnt.
No response yet about and Colin Kaepernick from Donald Trump, must have overslept....
Thats one hell of a marketing campaign for the sports giant. Lets just hope Geoffrey can shift some numbers.
Good on for supporting in their recent ads, and for not caring about the idiots behind . One of the reasons i'm a big fan
Just more old white man arrogance thinking Nike will suffer because conservatives won't buy their products. It's a Global multi billion dollar brand. US conservatives are a small fraction of revenue. Watch Nike post record sales after this move
well if the Nike Child labor practices wasn't enough maybe Hiring this idiot will be enough to bankrupt this ridiculous company!
Nike should endorse the N word so these same folks will stop using that too.
... why... I know that guy might not be such a great person but, do you really have to burn or cut your Nike products? That is not a boycott! You need to just not wear them or go buy from Nikes rival! THAT IS NOT WHAT A BOYCOTT IS!!!! Dang people these days...
Conservatives can be correct on certain social issues, But it's hilarious that conservatives I follow are so offended by this situation with . Conservatives and Liberals are often 2 sides of the same coin.
Not supporting Nike and the (sorry ) is going to be easy (goodbye Sunday Ticket)
When a brand support a unpatriot, racist, marxist, disrespectful bad player, i realize that Nike dont like western values, neither me. Never'll buy again.
is Extremely IRRELEVANT - Only stupid inbred racist cunts are going to boycott Nike - . No good American will be upset with Nike paying CK at all. Its just those people who hate blacks and wish they would shut up and be slaves. You know who.. DUHHH
JUST HATE POLICE , VETERANS AND THE USA SWOOSH
suddenly im getting only nike socks from now on just like the white guys from my old middle school
Damn and I was seriously looking at a pair of 270s for my son and I. Adidas it is now!
Ya tripping if Im ever gonna stop using Nike, because of this Im actually buying nike products even more. Thank you for standing up Nike.
Buy Made in the USA Running Shoes, Sneakers & Walking Shoes. List Below .
Im actually returning stuff to that I just bought!!!!
The side that doesnt support a company making a jackass who wears Cops as pigs socks their spokesman.
I 100% agree with a but not because of Colin - but because Nike run SWEATSHOPS, where their employees are more like indentured servants & basically force them to live in slums.
Conversely, if you are inclined to buy a new pair of sneakers because of an ad campaign, I strongly encourage you to donate the new pair. Make your point and do some good at the same time.
If you are inclined to destroy or throw away your sneakers because of an ad campaign, I strongly encourage you to donate the shoes instead of just destroying or throwing them away. Make your point and do some good at the same time.
Russian Bots pushing this story !!!
Time and time again we've seen our other fellow Americans beaten and killed by law enforcement unlawfully and received no justice.
..people are so emotional. Glad to see keeping the real issue going and not just the news of the day. I'll continue to support the product!!!
Hey racists, theres some veterans out on the streets who Im sure would appreciate a new pair of Airs. Maybe dont light them on fire like the entitled whining baby bitches you are, put your money where your mouth is, and actually support the troops for once
Racists running out to buy Nike socks so they can cut them up. Just Do It
So Im guessing these same folks would get rid of their animals if endorsed Colin Kaepernick......
stands for US. joins Iranian Dictators ,that killed thousands of US Soldiers, to trash America.
You are wrong. Nothing to do with skin tone- only asses support a company that makes their spokesman a man who wore Cops as pigs socks.
I was just getting ready this week to buy my son new Nikes as he outgrows his shoes fast (14) but.... we will be buying another brand! My Father and husband and brothers gave ALL for the USA and I won't support a company rewarding hate of our wonderful country!
Today,America jails Black people while Police keep shooting them,wow,just many ways is that picture panel wrong. so ALL jails are filled with black people and they are ALL not guilty?All Police Only Shoot Black People...you are not helping...
Conservatives be like: I'ma show the libs! I'm gonna cop the new Jordans, THEN BURN EM! Plus I'm gonna take my old Js and cut the logo out! Screw the SJWS!!!!!!!!!!!!
These toads are mad because supports Where was the outrage when your man-child had to be forced to lower flags to half staff for a deceased veteran & US Senator?
Yall cant be serious with this .....
Everyone who is burning and ripping up their clothes because of an ad is so stupid you worked for the money to buy those shoes (or for the scrubs your mom did) dont be so ignorant
for the I'm wondering if trumpists have considered donating their used Nikes to someone who may need them
Checks over stripes thats what i like s/o to nike for supporting a good man
How pathetic in today's USA, where our founders escape from political prosecution, we see folks deciding what to buy, where to go, etc because what other folks support politically. Any society has issues, but this kind of thinking is taking a step-back, period!
The Kaepernick cause is as vague & emptyheaded as the Nike campaign now celebrating it. Common sense, not racism, opposes both. America is not systemically racist. It's people who can be racist & they come in all colors, not just white.
Black people already make up the majority of Nike shoppers, guess they are just going all-in.
Good morning Patriots will spread worldwide due to traitors failure to respect & because they've now proven they will betray anyone on
This dude taped his socks back together!
seems like you could also donate all of those items to American Vets who are homeless & struggling rather than trying to prove a point? seems like you can live up to your values & support troops and vets rather than burning items that would keep them warm this winter
If you support the for representing someone who stands up for what they believe, you dont understand what America is all about.
People saying and are Un-American are just sad people. They don't get why he did it and it just she'd the light on America's dirty secret. Racism still is a problem.
I have been meaning to go get a new pair of shoes, guess I will be giving Under Armour a shot because I will not be buying nikes anymore.
This is so dumb. Instead of destroying your gear why don't you just donate it? It wouldn't make you look like such a dick.
MEANWHILE, Law Enforcement Agencies across the country CONTINUOUSLY disrespect the American Flag (and the public) by putting a "thin blue line" on it and brandishing it like a
Kaepernick jerseys, Keurig machines, now the Swoosh. Makes a lot sense to buy shit up that youre boycotting, just to destroy it to prove what point exactly?
Lmao dont worry they will still BUY your product just to destroy it.
Yes, because with non-US sales of 36.4 billion and with a domestic market that exceeds 358 billion we're sure the 1 to even 10% (On High Side) drop in business will really hurt them.
So Im just gonna say that anyone participating in this is a part of the KKK. Watch who tweets.
Boomercons r the worst thing ever. Why are u so angry about this kind of stuff? The memes r the best things ever, and burning old shirts doesn't do anything to Nike. They're still making bank off this "boycott", because u never bought their stuff in the first place
because it allows you to!
How are you guys affording NIke considering you don't have jobs cause all the illegal Mexicans stole them? Something doesn't add up?

It seems that Nike will be losing the business of trolls and fake profiles. I think they will survive.
The same White Racist Trash that burned their NFL jerseys, Praised the Nazi & KKK violence in Charlottesville need to set themselves on Fire.

So here is why is going to fail: it's being pushed by Republicans who in essence embrace capitalism and will still buy the product because they don't know how to inform each other how greed works. Conservative boycotts usually fail hard. Via.
I think its a waste of energy to explain now because everyone knows what its about they are just using the flag they represent instead of representing police killing people with 0 consequences
Aye yall boutta have a sale because you guys wanna apologize to the whites for doing something so horrible???? Just asking for a friend.
Nike hired a spokesman who openly hates:The policeThe militaryThe governmentCapitalismDemocracyAmerica Smart move, the deranged radical left will buy up all your over priced crap in droves...just as soon as they get government mandated jobs.
When you see . is the face of . you burn that $hit just as I did with all my . crap

Just bought 2 pairs!!! Will be buying as Christmas presents this year too
My son will be attending his first day of school 'Nike'd'; bag, shoes, cap & socks. Fake outrage from fake veteran supporters. Homeless veterans can use your socks and shoes...do yall really care about them?!
Great interview with former CIA operative on the IC community & global issues.Sam Faddis also wrote an open letter to John Brennan, who's currently praising . Don't miss it --->
Keep this same energy when shoes drop so I can get Chase the shoes he asks for on the Sneakers app.
If anyone doing this wants to just give their stuff away I wear a size 12 shoe and will graciously accept anything XL or larger. Everything that does fit will be donated. DM me for an address.
Funny to see so many black faces tweeting stupidity. The isn't for you ... everyone knows there isn't a damn thing that will keep any of you from buying the Air Jordans and shooting each other for them. LMAO
The racists are out today using this hashtag lol
.. Boycott why? Because of Colin? This is BS
I bet realized the same dopes boycotting them will just go buy Jordans cause theyre too stupid to know its the same company.
Businesses need to be neutral and not play identity politics.
When you look around and you're one of a large group of angry white guys complaining about what a company is doing to support a non-white person...maybe, just maybe, there's some racism involved. Well...there is racism involved, who are you kidding???
my ass, yall aint about that life, just playing a typical internet rebel!
is bull$(&!!Not interested in appeasing who take issue with Black lives.It's not against our soldiers and the US flag.
I really don't understand this whole Nike boycott thing or how the flag comes in. Americans are so confusing.
After you burn your Nikes sit back and enjoy a nice cup of joe. Wait. You can't because you smashed your Kuerig last year!
These people supporting this will burn their things just to buy them again about two months from now.
Another day, another ridiculous boycott. Instead of cutting up Nike shoes with scissors or what not just because Nike signed a deal with someone you don't like, why not give the shoes to someone who could really use them, such as homeless people?
TRUTH BOMB: All the Trump Apologists claiming they will actually want to say boy and cotton in the same sentence.
Wow. Really in shock nike would endorse a black dude. Safe to say i will never buy their products again. Hell, I won't ever buy shoes again, so the entire industry fails.
Lol girl I wore to work today just for the heck of it! Im here for this!!!! yall some clowns...NIKE GOT MY SUPPORT
Good job Asics and Hush Puppies haven't taken a stance against racial inequality otherwise all those mad old bastards wouldn't have anything to wear.
More Importantly we have Communist Companies like Nike Supporting Muslims Against The American People ! The American People better Wake up ! They Try Censorship & Try to Silence to Gain Power over The American People !
Nike signs 8 year extension with NFL. Nike puts Colin Kaepernick on "Just Do It" campaign.
I was boycotting Nike for a long time because their abhorrent labor practices. Not for easily triggered racism
How does one remove the logos from Air VaporMax Flyknit shoes? Just bought them, big mistake. Going back to Brooks.
Novo Nordisk just hired Colin Kaepernick to promote their insulin products? Retweet if you'll and support the troops!
Seriously...those of you who are burning your Nikes, or don't want them anymore, donate them. Many need shoes.
Nike selects Colin Kaepernick for ‚ÄòJust Do It ad campaign
It's a good thing I only wear Zips, because I wouldn't want to be accused of not supporting our troops
Done with you, Nike, and so is my entire family, for this outrageous insult.
you're mad because Black folks are trying to protect their kids.You're angry at people trying to stop murder.....
You stand for DISRESPECT of our Policeforce when you should be standing with the men and women who sacrificed their lives for all of us! You are way off base and disgusting!! I fixed your ad!!!
Never Thought I'd Annunciate this Sentence But here goes The Million's Of Our U.S Brothers & Sisters Who Refuse To Bow Down To , &
exploiting our countrys weaknesses for personal gain. Marketing team celebrating while pulling off old scabs and picking at our wounds. That is what is unAmerican.
Whoever in Nike came up with this Colin Kaepernick Ad Campaign should be FIRED, they just committed suicide and took the company with them. JUST DO IT... Support our troops, cops and flag, burn those Nikes!!!
The NFL franchise is one mostly exclusive to the USA, your boycott mattered.The Nike franchise is INTERNATIONAL.You're not even a dent in their pockets. USA is only a portion of the profits...and you're a tiny fraction of that.
The problem for is that there are just way too many non-political alternatives for footwear & apparel.
Private companies can hire who they want and get behind who they want. Conservatives have long memories, and liberals attempt their boycotts but fizzle out when the next cause come about. Ask Dicks sporting goods, Chik Fila and In and Out Burger. This will backfire.
before you start burning your items go ahead and donate them to a homeless shelter. im sure one of the millions of homeless could use them
is bull Kaepernick is standing up for American's while is tearing it down and yall want to boycott Nike burn and throw away all ur Nike material yall r stupid only Trump supporters is doing this stupid stuff congrats on dividing our country POTUS
Make no mistake about it. doesn't give a crap about Colin Kaepernick or his fake cause. They're hoping all of this publicity leads to a bigger bottom line. They're using to make a buck.Just like the slave traders in the 1800s.
Why are white People so mad because someone is speaking out about the injustice to Black People?...Because they want it to remain that way...
Using the heavily paraphrased words of J.K Rowling, "I've already got your money so by all means use my scissors"
Only in America can u be the face of a shoe company/while simultaneously suing said companys largest client. lol
If you are due to then you are boycotting for the wrong reason. I stopped buying when i found that they used child labor and paid them pennies.SJW will pay 100s for shoes while the people making the shoes can't afford to eat more than 1 meal a day.
BEST PHOTOGRAPHY AWARD 2018YOUTUBE : GROUP: PLUS : GROUP:
Since you're all throwing away your gear today, don't destroy it. I'll take it. I just lost 50 pounds. It'll be a cheaper option for me than buying it new. Thanks in advance...
You cannot fight social injustice while simultaneously being socially unjust to the men and women in .
Nike just gave away half their market to and Such a massive business mistake in an ultra competitive marketplace.
All these racist people who want the , Nike was just fine for you when they were using sweatshops overseas but NOW, you don't want your Nikes? GTFOH
Instead of burning the Items you morons paid good money for just because a pro athlete peacefully and respectfully brings attention to racial inequality/violence, perhaps you can burn some calories and the hatred in your hearts.
dumbasses be buying nike stuff just to destroy it
I wish people of this great nation would used this same energy to help others. People would rather destroy than give. SMH
Why Should We Cause They Support A Man Who Wants Racial InJustice And Police Brutality To Stop NO RACIST I WILL SUPPORT COLIN KAEPERNICK AND NIKE
Hicks and Russian bots don't buy Nike. I usually buy Puma, but my next sneakers are definitely Nike. Looks like will lead to epic increase in profits for Nike.
Finally these White Supremacist will change their stink molding dirty dusty sneakers for once.
Burning a shoe that you already bought sure is showing them .. If you wanna be a real American burn up a store ... social justice bad asses .. half of this is for likes and follows btw lol
It's ok to be against your own President but people can't boycott Nike because they don't agree with them? Yea ok that's not calling the kettle black or nothing is it?
BEST PHOTOGRAPHY AWARD 2018YOUTUBE : GROUP: PLUS : GROUP:
Imagine if the folk stick to their guns and the Nike brand becomes associated with making Trump supporters sad. What an incredible marketing win that would be. Almost as if they planned this from the start.
The ones really boycotting Nike because of a commercial are bout dumb as hell , like let that man believe in what he wants to believe in goofy
Damn, all nine of you Chads participating in this must really love police brutality.
idgi. why don't they just throw the item away rather than cut the label and keeping what is now a torn piece of clothing.
COIT Car is sad summer is over but happy because he'll be hanging out during football season with his new brother COIT Kid who is ready to go!Call COIT to get your air ducts cleaned!
Just Do It- Burn them shoes
Hey sheeple, burnin ur gear just means ure gonna need to buy new, soon. Just helps sales.
Nike sold $34 BILLION- INTERNATIONAL SALES, $1B just in CHINA. Let that sink in. It is not all about North Americans, . Also, I highly recommend this book by Nike founder. = no, I wont!
All I've seen on Twitter that's mad about this Kaepernick co-sign from Nike are literally ALL white people...seriously, why is that?
If you want to raise awareness do something similar to what leagues do for breast cancer and other causes, wear certain shoes, pins etc, dedicate a month to it, make your CAUSE CLEAR. Kneeling for the National Anthem is just shitting on the USA.
Gonks burning their gear because somebody in the public eye decided to stand up (neal down) for a cause they believed in, a major company recognises a strong character when they see one
Half of Puerto Rico doesn't have power, there is a water crisis in Flint, and too many people in this country cant afford food today. If we put one ounce of the energy behind the behind an issue that actually mattered, we could solve it in a week. Wanna ? Focus.
When I saw & thought they did something wrong, but it turns out its just the racist at it again, so there wont be an 80% clearance sale...
So people are burning their own (not cheap) clothes and gear over an ad? Or worse, buying it just to burn it. That's ignorant and selfish. I bet there are people who could use that clothing. But I forgot, you don't care about other people.
I will NEVER buy another product. Ever.A company that supports those spoiled thug millionaires who disrespect our Flag and our National Anthem doesn't deserve my business!
New Balance - made in the USA!
Funny how everyone in this country can hate and have opinions about our President and it's ok but people can't dislike Nike because they don't agree with Kap or Nike sponsoring him....calling the kettle black....SMH...
In regards to the . My objection to Colin Kaepernick wasn't the fact that he disrespects the flag. It's the cause that he does it for. Racism. He is a racist. Period.
Shoe Salesman: What size shoe would you like?Dump Customer: Well, I usually burn a 9.
The white supremacist dipshits now calling 4 didn't do so a month ago because sexism & misogyny goes with racism & anti-Blackness.(Both true: kudos to re: Kap, & fuck Nike for abusing/exploiting workers)
Looking for a pair of women's size 7 all white Nike Air MAX Thea.. to.. burn of course.. bc I hate Nike. Obviously.. Go !
These evil racist whatever they are forget they are the minority. Most of us love our country, & believe in law and order. We hate anything. Fools will put themselves out of business with their stupidity & hatred towards the majority.
Americans now express their political views through consumerism. This weakens democracy for the poor, and reduces all of us to advertising budget targets. Don't worry about what brand is marked on your shoe. Get out the vote.
Lets be totally honest, this is the only Nike shoe whose sales might drop because of this
Is it bad that I can't help but snicker at the fact that is trending? If you haven't figured out why kaep kneeled for the anthem despite being told over and over and over again, you might be a virulent racist. You might just be moron. Either or.
great milestone for . Stock is already down by 2.33. Ouch. Make famous. LoL.
If skips chocolate cake for a few weeks she'll be the next spokesperson. boycotted a long time ago. Not because of this or the 'peasant workforce' they command. I don't like the swoosh as a design. I'm all .
Anent the , two other things:1. The "blue lives matter movement" violates the US flag code . Stop buying late capitalist crap in general, including overpriced shoes from Nike, or Adidas, or Reebok.
Curious... where did you pull that stat from?
you are second fiddle to anyway. Have fun with your ridiculous business decision
is now trending in United Kingdom
This man represents hate and violence against our Police. "Just Do It" is a direct threat against the American People. should be charged for inciting hate and rioting.
Tried giving mine to a homeless vet but he was disgusted and burned them
In my opinion this is a joke & an example of how people only hear what they want to hear. Glad I just got me a new pair of Air Max 95s this weekend
The Donald keep like to assure him racist support base, that him no buy him man pantys from the . Him continue to have each pair special made from fitted bedsheet.
Dont agree with Nikes attempt to label a hero but burning the thousands of dollars of Nike attire Ive already paid for would make me an oxymoron.
First NFL allows players (who are making millions in United States) to kneel for the Anthem and now Nike? Since when did the flag and the Anthem become offensive? Trump makes a solid point regarding the NFL...
Lol, so everybody that's boycotting , are we burning the Jordans to? this shit is ridiculous.
Just a reminder to the boycotters... the Nike swoosh appears on your favorite NFL team jersey... yeah, Im talking to YOU and your team
Says it all people. Boycott NIKE Now!!! Kaepernick earns support from diverse chorus, including John Brennan, over Nike ad
They dont care about veterans. They dont care about America or the flag. They just hate people of color.
It you want to do the crap, give me an articulate reason as to why & why Trump using the flag as a revenge tactic against McCain was different, & we may still reciprocate following one another. If you can't, you're obviously racist and retarded like your daddy Trump.
Your a big winner for taking a stand for what you believe in. Dont hold back. Just do it
Liberals are making fun of people for being angry at Nike over using a politically divisive person in their ad. Its reasonable considering they would be just fine with say, Donald Trump in an ad. They would NEVER boycott a company over that. NEVER!
just screwed up big time! I know they lost about 1k a year off of me and Im sure Im not the only one! Under Armour here I come!
... Nike was the Goddess of speed, strength and victory. Not colluding, cheating on spouses and being racist. Lol at all the MAGA morons looking through their closets to be outraged
Brings all the out to call anyone who dares to boycott a company who would use an anti-American, anti-Cop, person who does not use good judgement for anything a "." Those who accuse are usually always guilty of what they blame on others.
I haven't bought a pair of 's in forever, but I just might now because of the .
can Nike make a black strapless midi dress? I want to support, but my husband said if I buy anymore workout gear he is going to divorce me.
The only People that are boycotting Nike because of ...Is racist white folks...
The bots working this are hilarious
I just heard about the endorsement. Wonderful. This makes shopping for my family easier. Holiday sales may soften the impact, but Im curious about impact to their top line.
TO ALL OUT THERE: Buy shoes & burn them. Then buy more & burn them. Trust me... It will fix everything.
Never again will I support a brand a person who doesnt support he has created a division among people that was never there before. Dont believe me just look back prior to the kneeling, look at it now. You support this?
CKs triumph literally brings some justice to all who faced injustice in this country. He stood up for them,
I'm embarrassed of this pic b/c of the decadence but here it is. I have tons of Nike clothing too b/c they make quality products and I obviously have issues, not b/c of the swoosh. My favorite running shoes are On Cloud, I have more of them than Nike.
. You know who is pushing ?Putins bots! Most prob arent even Americans! Check out Hamilton 68 to see what trends Putins bits are pushing. They are all over Jeff Sessions, too.
burning clothes that can go to people in need is wrong period give the clothes to a shelter dont burn it because youre mad..just dont buy in the future if you feel that way...theres people in countries that have nothing and your burning your $300 fucking shoes
Everyone on this BS are just burning their dad shoes
Fellas we have to defeat !! Bring all your Nike sneakers preferably size 11 to my house and I will burn them in my secret fire place!!! Dm me if you would like to do this also Jordans are Nike so bring them too
Nike selects Colin Kaepernick for ‚ÄòJust Do It ad campaign No more Nike in our house!!!
The failing Nike is trying to cash in on an agenda like the pointless and yet fatherless customers. Too bad they are just biting from the hand that feeds them called, America. Sad!
White folks boycotting . I dont know why I find this hilarious. They mad !!!!
Too bad these so-called patriots that are rallying behind this arent gonna use that extra money to help the tens of thousands of homeless vets. Instead theyll step over these vets, on their way to getting another iPhone, so they can tweet muh military.....
I don't usually support boycotts, but I will support the . I am not going to give money to a company that has made it very clear that they hate me because of the color of my skin.
Everyone talking about this , just went through twitter and didnt find a single video or tweet in support of it. Leftys really do blow shit way out of proportion. Calm down.
I don't take this so called seriously at all.
That awkward moment when folks realize that Rule of marketing is Market to Your Target. Pretty sure trashy rednecks aren't even on their radar. 's no fool. They'll rake in the $$$ while they wait for y'all head to combust.
just threw my Nikes in the trash and purchased a pair of Adidas
To those burning their to support the ... you all must be some rich ass people... I workhard for my money & spend it where I want to & I'm not just going to throw that away because of a sales ad ... a clothing brand doesnt define a person .. it's just clothes
Man, a lot of homeless and needy veterans could sure use all the Nike shoes and clothes people are throwing out, but priorities ya know?
NIKE Marketing execs must have lost their collective minds by getting on the end of the 'Kaepernick-UnAmerican' daisy-Chain. It's one thing not going to a NFL game-- but it will be quite another thing when NIKE's sales drop significantly, and retailers drop them!
Hey Nike. good call. Ive been wanting to try out some other gear and youve just given me the best reason ever to never buy your product again. Any of it.
Because they DONT really care about veterans, they just hate people of color. But you knew that.
Nikes are the 1st pair of shoes my parents ever bought me, I could NEVER support a
This makes me glad that I decided to only purchase running shoes from now on. The is ridiculous. I think deserves the recognition and the lucrative ad deal for all that he's done.
Look, I have to be somewhere later today, so before we start a , let me get my Starbucks first and stream the cast album of Hamilton so I can get in the usual boycott mood, k?
Is it time for me to boycott after naming Colin Kaepernick the face of the Just Do It campaign??
I want shoe companies to keep having fantastic, strong, principled men as their spokespeople so that eventually, all that whiny conservative douches will have to wear on their feet are just grocery bags.
Somewhere in the US, one of your people is killing another one of your people over sneakers. And nobody gives a fuck.
If you are participating in the because of you're an asshat. This company has been making clothes and shoes in child sweatshops since the beginning and you care more about a guy taking a knee. You might not think so, but you're an uneducated racist.
Just bought a nice new pair of Under Armour cross-trainers. I have bought in the past, but never again.
I should go buy a pair a vapes just for the
yall better wake up and take that red pill Nike before yall dont have any customers left!
Im done with Nike......just sad
i'm gonna go out and buy my 4th pair of nike running shoes just to piss off the rednecks in this tag
About 11% of the adult homeless population are veterans.Instead of being mad about something YOU CANNOT CONTROL, support America's HOMELESS VETERANS. Donate your gently worn Nikes instead of burning them. JUST DO IT!Nike, let's start the campaign to donate!
I'm too poor to participate in either side of this I ain't gonna buy no new shit and I DAMN SURE won't burn some shit I already boughtI'll just sit here and eat my food lol

- Fans Burn Nike Gear in Response to Colin Kaepernicks ‚ÄòJust Do It Ad Campaign
OMG DISGUSTING CANT WAIT TO BURN THESE
Nike took it to the next level. You wanted it out of your sport, now your false narratives against flag, anthem and military are great again. Now back to systemic judicial injustices.
I hope all you idiots know an actual Vet unlike 97% of you complaining told that kneeling would be more of a sign of respect. Not sure why people are pushing this garbage.
$NKE is down 2.62% in Pre-Market that's a lost of $3 Billion in Market Cap as Patriots all around the country are burning and boycotting their products for using an American flag kneeler for their outrageous ad.
And I was just thinking I needed a pair of all white forces
If you are currently cutting up your clothes in an effort to boycott Nike for throwing support behind a black athlete who wants fairness, equality, and justice for all... you might be a racist.
So, I just got on Twitter. Saw the whole thing. I think I'll pass on today's stupidity. I'm out.
Seriously if you want to do this stupid crap, at least donate your gear to the homeless or a veterans group like where people can use it!
I support the . I can cut them just like I cut out the . I don't condone Colin Kaepernick's racism and anyone that does is not someone that gets my hard earned money.
Racism is still alive. Theyve just been concealing it.

Forget - just don't buy anything they sell associated with . Done! That will send a message to that having him as a rep for the brand is pointless.
The people who freak out over this image now changes what it means to me. To me, it's like a check for a census.Are you any of the following?- Inflammatory racist [ ]- Supporter of lousy president [ ]- Wouldn't be caught dead donating to the homeless [ ]
I wholeheartedly support and
Those that want to join the ... I know you guys don't want to "spread the hate" as you say, but how about give that clothing to a homeless person who could really use it instead of burning or destroying it? That would at least be more Christian.
Ive never seen so many busted kicks in my life omG
darn, I just bought some
I wholeheartedly support and
So here is why is going to fail: it's being pushed by Republicans who in essence embrace capitalism and will still buy the product because they don't know how to inform each other how greed works. Conservative boycotts usually fail hard.
Excuse me while I go clean my nikes and wear them proudly.
I've just finished editing a 10 minute video on ad, if there is anyone who would like to help me share when it's up, please inbox me
Some folk will never ever get it because they have their own ignorant racist agenda!
Im more confused on why you have a unsigned athlete marketing gear. You get the publicity you want but not from the field. You knew it would make headlines and thats what you were banking on.
The KAP is a fraud and eveyone has jumped in because they are ignorant. We hear nothing about him or anyone else making a change, anyone can voice their opinion and sit idol. My voice is with those who are banning the NFL and the
When you have ultra America haters like , a president of , and NFL fans, supporting someone, that someone is a serious America hating scumbag.

Kap just encapsualted a generation in a single quote - and I think I'll buy a new pair of Jordans today -
Destroying your own stuff just to own the libs. That'll show 'em.
Thanks I just ordered 2 pairs of sneakers and 4 pairs of socks. NO for this house.
I just thinks its funny that Nike is a worldwide company and that confirmation hearings begin today and hes not good for the Supreme Court...hes good for a racist agenda. should remember November is around the corner and too.
: 's signing of to be the face of their new campaign is particularly interesting since the just re-upped as the official partner to the league for another 10 years.
I have not bought anything Nike in years! I cannot wait to buy something Nike this weekend! The Americans who think Nike has just crucified itself will learn the power of globalisation! . Maybe now, will finally understand economics.
Imagine the MAGA psychotic break that would occur if Mountain Dew, NASCAR and pork rinds were to support Kap
More noise. Point of kneeling lost in the overshadowing of disrespect to flag (real or perceived). We're fighting about a rich corporation while 6 people shot in Chicago just this weekend. So tired of rhetoric while our country unravels.
Me: Leaving the store after I max my credit card in support of the new campaign, , , et all.(These idiots are out here burning clothes, as if a pile of gym sock ashes is going to shut down this GLOBAL brand)
What they pushing for Michael Dunn to get one?
What if Nicki owned Everything?? Would the trump supporters walk Around Naked ???
One thing is for sure - this collaboration announcement certainly got BUZZ. Today's curated fashion industry news is available at:
I just bought a new hat. Oh well... looks like it's time for a new one.
Tone deafness of so much of corporate America is no longer astonishing as Nike follows in the NFL's footsteps and alienates half of its consumer base. Nike used to be a company that celebrated athletic excellence, now they have become a social justice corporation.
The amount of blatant racism over this ad is ridiculous. White people really are that self-serving that, god forbid, anyone who doesnt look like them demand to be treated with respect and dignity.
My husband, son, father, and grandfather have all fought for this country and her flag! They made great sacrifices for our country to keep the blood from our shores!Kneeling during the anthem is deeply offensive to military families!
Racisms still alive, they just be concealing it.
Everything about this is a mediated mind f000. Kaepernick gets paid to represent his movement, which Nike uses to sell sneakers that r manufactured in Vietnam sweatshops, to Americans who think they're "woke." & Nike gets to skate for using slave labor.
White Privilege...Kneeling players of color: "It's about police brutality and racial injustice."Donald Trump: "It's about disrespecting the Military, the flag, and America."You: "It's about whatever Donald Trump says it's about."
Ill be watching , wearing purchased at , and drinking beers chilled in . I wont be cheating on my wife or conspiring with Russian oligarchs. Not
the hashtag is just a bunch of tweets supporting Nike.. amazing
Just Dump Trump.
"hm I don't want my Nike anymore. They don't uphold the same values as me...Maybe I should BURN IT AND DESTROY IT....oooor maybe I could just give it to people in need and no longer give them my business?"
, . What a powerful message. No in this house- proud to wear a logo that stands for good.
Just ordered some running clothes and shoes! I support companies who have the cojones to take a stand.
1) RE: People looking to stick it to Nike, rather than destroy their apparel, should give it to the homeless. Nike's appeal comes from its brand. If every OTHER person wearing was homeless, would its usual customers still want to wear ?
Before everyone burns and ruins their Nike apparel, why not donate to the homeless veterans? Or to a lower income community? It makes zero sense to destroy it in the first place, so you should put those items to good use.
It seems that has declared war on a sizable portion of its customers. If I was stupid enough to own their stock, I would demand that heads roll after this.
LMFAOOOOO yall doing this lil thing obviously dont know that the young sneakerheads are one of the BIGGEST contributors to Nike when they buy $200 or $300 sneakers. Not yall who buy those all-white fresh out the hospital 4s that cost $60 at Kohls
Pass... I will burn the Nikes and buy two pairs of shoes for homeless Plus have a little money left over to buy him a blanket some clean underwear and maybe a haircut and then I will take him/her to lunch 7 times That should be about the same price as Nikes
So it must be that curriculums at lefty college business schools are: virtual signal your polarized ideological stance, that has nothing to do with product, so that you can seriously reduce your client base and cut profits. So much fail.
Hey your Trump National Golf Club proudly sells Nike products. (Screen shot from Trump National website below.) Wonder how your base is going to feel about that given they are burning Nike products because Colin Kaepernick is in their new ad?!
Damn fools - are you upset that a black guy with principals got an ad campaign or because Nike didn't put a logo on the Grand Dragons' robes?
Watch for Nike stock to crash...just like Targets did Nike will learn the hard way
Just bought myself some new trainers. I wasnt in the market for new shoes yet, but I their campaign. The Libs will buy enough to offset the Nazi boycott!
Or is it that the left simultaneously loves capitalism while decrying how unfair it is
. Out buying new shoes today! Wont be Nikes! My dad was a WW11, Korea, and Viet Nam vet. Served our country and fought for us. Nike wants to put an overpaid once employed football player who takes a knee on their cover as a hero? Hell no! Goodbye Nike!
love how those complaining about being uninvited to event are calling for because they like exercising
Ok that's fine can you support the from that perspective- All of the nike factories are located in Asia. Not made in USA cheap labor no $15 per hour jobs there!
You have the support of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. That should pretty much sum things up. I hope you're proud!
Most muslims don't stand for our Flag or Anthem, they're here to divide and conquer! Go to They're under here in the USA. are pretty much as well!

I don't know if Twitter is just showing me what they think I wanna see, but I see a majority of hilarious posts just hijacking this hashtag.
Sir the are doing a because of our new ...Nike CEO:
many were murdered because of Colin?. Lets think about that fact!! nw disrespecting police is Not Ok
Just FYI y'all: Colin has had a Nike deal since 2011.
is hilarious. Burning/throwing away your stuff does absolutely nothing. little snowflakes
Trust me... NOBODY is going to remember C.K.!
Major company marketing meetings start with how can we get people talking about us. They really dont care what you think. Nikes worth $100B+. They can take risks and look... it worked.
People who say: I just bought 12 pairs of Nike shoes and will buy Nike EVERY day. Take THAT, boycotters....are probably lying. People who say: I just burned all 200 Nike items I own and will NEVER buy Nike again. Take THAT, Nike lovers....are probably lying.
Major sell off of Nike stock expected Over backlash from just do it campaign Wall Street

D. Whichever way the wind blows against our POTUS. They will reap what they sew. America is better than ever before and will take it to them if this is what they want. Farewell Nike
People take shit too seriously.
So y'all seriously boycotting nike when the environment is fucked up MORE than ever,black people still not getting justice, and Flinton stilll don't got no water.oh plus the massive fire that happened. Is no one looking at the bigger picture
You obviously don't know football. about about you follow that link and look at this great quarterback! You're both fucking fools!
.... THIS is what it means to take a knee for your country
So its okay to boycott Nike over Kaepernick, but everyone is fine with them use cheap labor from sweat shops.
Maybe needs to change it's tag line from "Just Do It" to "Just Kneel It" or "Just Disrespect It".
If you're gonna boycott Nike, then maybe don't buy their stuff just to burn it.
All this nike boycott makes me want to go and buy some nikes lol gotta love America for Ps usa can be so dramatic lol
Conservatives are boycotting Nike for supporting Colin Kaepernick so here's why I support Kaep.
"I said it about every other boycott that was too stupid to realize the actual obvious. While everyone pushes ideology remember this one fact: They have to BUY the products to burn / destroy them. Still adding profit to the company.".
Most hilarious post I've seen is someone saying that they are throwing away their Nike gear b/c this is so important to them that they don't want anyone else to be able to wear Nike either. Um. Ok. Not the homeless vets? I'm sure a lot of them would accept it gladly.
Boy, other famous faces of Nike need to speak out. Hear Serena Williams agrees with
a.k.a im racist but i need to use this as an excuse
Didnt yall try this with the NFL jerseys a few years ago? And didnt yall realize they didnt give a fuck because they already had your money? Im sensing a similar trend with Nike bc Im sure Nike has already calculated the risk vs reward and decided its worth it
There's no reason to burn your Nikes, just wear your hoods in public. Identity concealed/comfortable feet. It's a win-win.
HILARIOUS OKAY RT : Stay Mad: Colin Kaepernicks New Nike Deal Has No-Face-Towel-Twitter Destroying Their Clothes And Its Hilarious
The best part about being a Nike fan, is you can design your own shoes! Husband may be a republican, but hes still going to be spending a lot of money on Nike bc stepdaughter and me have a Nike addiction. 23 pairs and counting!
Im gonna just do it... just stop buying your brand. What a bad decision is NOT an American leader as a veteran Im appalled
Just so that's it clear those on the train understand will win and win and WIN because they understand
I would bet FLOTUS makes a public appearance in Nike apparel in the near future. is dumb.
If you want to laugh at racist people making idiotic comments about patriotism and respecting the troops just check it here lmfaooo
So basically, Nike chose Kaepernick because he risked everything ...and in turn, Nike is risking everything by signing Kaepernick to their brand.
b4 any scotus Feinstein Stop hearings & sue GOP to get all the thousands of papers on that republicans are hiding from Dems congress & America. NO
BEST PHOTOGRAPHY AWARD 2018YOUTUBE : GROUP: PLUS : GROUP:
But your destroying stuff you already bought seriously
So I guess we now know some Nike customers were just extremely racist. Well enjoy being a temporary trend on the internet. I have some Nikes to buy
Lol yall can do this if yall want too. But I support and Plus they got good shoes lol
So we are continue to ignore the fact it was a Veteran that suggested that Kaepernick because it is also a practice that thise in military use as a sign of respect?
Anyone using pictures of Veterans to justify their bullshit had better check themselves and get permission from that Veteran or their family.
Yo, if any of you Americans wanna send me your Nikes, I will do all of you a favor and accept them. Preferably AF1s or Airmaxs but Im accepting all. Im Canadian, so they will be leaving your country, win win for all. Especially me
This guy disrespected our country and doesnt have a job but makes more money than 25 veterans families who really sacrificed everything..... riddle me that.
Wait sneaker heads does that mean sneakers burn will go up in price cause I think I got a pair
Understand that participating in the by destroying merch that you already owned for months/years isnt hurting Nike at all. Youre mutilating old apparel, while people on the correct side of history are spending money/supporting Nike by buying new apparel.
oh ya'll wanna lmao for putting a mans face forward who actually went out and did what nike slogan says when it came to standing up for a good cause or should I say kneeling for a good cause bringing awareness to social injustice and police brutality
Not sure what the big fuss is about, Nike shoes have sucked since version 3 of Air Jordans.
is gonna make think again.How long til is removed as the face on the 30th anniversary 'Just Do It' campaign (but they'll continue to pay him)?Colin Kaepernick is not woke.
This is MAGA:One of many grifters, scammers, and or criminal characters propagating MAGA is Michael J Gross aka ThebestcLoser. Those who follow, support, and or endorse these clowns are complicit as well. =
for what? Yall love to be fake outraged. Kaepernick just playing his part. He and those of his ilk always stand for something even if its just to say NOTHING of importance
Hey Nike you just stepped in it
Lmao and they call us snowflakes
Why would our veterans want to wear a product supported by a left wing, anti-American, anti-military, anti-logic, idiot? Thats just dumb.
many were murdered because of Colin?. Lets think about that fact!! nw disrespecting police is Not Ok
Me waiting on Nike store to open so I can support
don't use the denigration of a sacred American ritual to further your false narrative, that is what is all about, what is yours/their end goal? to have us all kneel during the national anthem!!!
I just came to collect any Nike size 9s in women's in new to gently used condition. Yall ain't gotta burn them, just mail them to me
I'm getting to the point where I'm just going to go out and purchase anything you ask me to boycott. Just to piss you all off. You worry about sneakers, and I'll worry about Tramp/Pottie/Mob
because we dont need our homeless walking around with that anti-american swoosh symbol either, thats why!
- Just admit you hate us n*ggers and move on. This hashtag has NOTHING to do with the anthem or vets or flag. It proves racism thrives and that no one - not the President, not the NHL, not you - gives a shit about black people. What next ? FOH.
If I was a City fan, I'd be joining in the , just because of that terrible third kit.
People are destroying their because of ?Shame on you, your is showing.
The same people out here burning their Nikes are the same folks whos families use to burn crosses- This was never about disrespecting our amazing troops or our flag!
It really shows Americas true colors. I will continue to rock Nike. Its sad to see more than half the people who will boycott are white women and men. This country is truly divided its sad. Half those people never had to sacrifice.
Replace your with a good pair of at least they make some of them here in the USA!
Son: Dad! You burned all my clothes because they had on them! I have nothing to wear to school!Dad: ‚ÄòMurica!
Havent bought Nike in years. But I will now! Only racists support
BEST PHOTOGRAPHY AWARD 2018YOUTUBE : GROUP: PLUS : GROUP:
Bro did you seriously spend time on videoing yourself destroying apparel that you PAID for, probably with a credit card?
get it Nike!!! They are brave and follow their own slogan. They said Just Do it and did! Love it
Outrage isnt growing. The same people are the same people outraged over POC having a public voice, platform and support.
I wonder, how many of We The People know the deference between Unity and Unison? Knowing the difference is to appreciate democracy. Ignorence is the root of evil.
What if I told you that you can't participate in the if you already purchased their products? Burning/destroying the things you previously paid for does not hurt 's profit, it just means you wasted your money.
because my crocs are better!
...just saying DONT On da other hand very fine people will fall in line w/all things that obstructs EQUALITY 4all Americans. Kneeling is not their issue. Imagine if this outrage was used 2shine da light on Govt 2provide more help4 Puerto Rico
"Liberals are such sensitive snowflakes"-People who destroy their already purchased their coffee makers, Nikes, get triggered by someone kneeling and refuse to drink Starbucks for 'attacking Christmas' because they put out a red cup in NOVEMBER.
Just remember... if you're not to thrilled about new campaign, has the collection through the foundation that supports our troops and their families.
Here is the real reason did this (see below). If you have kids, you know and other brands have surpassed Nike from a status standpoint. This is a bid to get back into the spotlight, nothing else.
So this will be easy. Same as your boycott against Hamilton the Musical. Lol
While these ignorant, Trump mind controlled folks are calling for a because is the face of their *Just Do it* campaign is ridiculous. You need to think about those made to you in 2016. You all are still struggling.
If yall are burning your Nike stuff just know I wear a size 14 in shoes and a 2X in shirts.... Your donations are much appreciated
ALL FOR THE WRONG REASONS. It's just all blood money wrung out from low wage workers and poor working conditions with no benefits.

i should wear all my nike shit today just cause I know UNT got hella trump supports
Personally, if I respected the military so much, instead of tearing up, cutting and burning my gear like a spoiled little child, I would donate them to help veterans who are in need. But thats just me.

Nah. I'm boycotting the communist Pope too. I do everything I can, not to support communists.,, whether they're communist rapists, or just regular, america-hating communists.
Maybe police brutality will decrease if the Blue Line wore performance shoes like athletes. Just a thought for all the winning in the field.
Am I the only one whos confused?
All of the middle aged white men and women that look as if they have never set foot in a gym or on a field saying they are going to boycott is f'king hilarious What will you wear to Disney once a year?
Don't worry 's soundman! I just sent you a dozen Nike socks as a gift. Wear em, or destroy em, still got their money!
Damm this is something serious damm at least I wont see a line for those rare shoes now thank u thank u
Why ? What Im trying to figure out:‚Ä¢ Did Kaep ever spit on the flag?‚Ä¢ Did Kaep ever burn the flag or drag it behind his car?‚Ä¢ Did Kaep ever turn a hose on the flag?Just trying to figure out all the outrage over someone taking a stand against social injustice
As seen on our dog walk: a grade schooler waiting for his bus. DECKED OUT in head to toe: shirt, backpack, shorts, socks and shoes. I gave him a high five. He just smiled back.
just bought my new Nike shoes and customized them. Meet the new Nike Arfs.
is the lamest thing I've heard since a few days ago.Fair enough if these were principled boycotts. But they're not. It's just dumb tribalism.
you couldve used a better person for the face of your campaign...
Cultural imperialism means that companies like don't depend on the for sales. The is hilarious because in addition to the millions of new customers in the US, internationally the brand is trending again. is a global conversation
yoooooo for you "boycotters" bring them shoes over to my house... Size 13, Size 12 ACG....
Conservative talking heads like who complain about private businesses hiring who they want, calling it "hating America", are also part of the problem.

I can't wait to put my nike shoes on this morning and step out into the world and just do it as Nike made a great and fair ove by putting someone on their campaign who is trying to show what this country should be standing for because obviously our vets have lost it
I threw out a pair of Nikes yesterday. But it wasn't a thing. I fully support Mr Kaepernick in his quest to shed light on injustice & unfairness. I threw out the Nikes because they were decades old & it was long past time, that's all.
Nike better ramp up production because sales are about to get nuts.
is unfair because 's culture encourages people to speak out and take action in all aspects of life.
Idiots burn perfectly good shoes and tear up socks/clothing. Socks/shoes are most needed items in shelters. Cold weather coming could use a pair of socks,shoes and warm clothing. but hey..waste your already purchased items
No Nikes for the Nazis? Just say no to the ;Sloppy Steve and Stephen Miller can wear their New Balances (official shoes of the white people; according to the KKK).
Oh, I guess is a thing that's happening now.I'm sure it'll be a huge success, just like the previous 20ish boycotts we've had this year.
how you gunna put that disguisting human that ruined that ruined this world as the face of your 30 year anniversary you just basically took 30 years and put it down the drain an absolute disgrace!
If you were good with as a company when they were *just* using child labor to make your shoes but are now destroying things you already paid for because they put in a commercial, it says a lot about you as a person and none of it is positive.
I am all for & hope the whole company goes bankrupt.But you see, it was a brilliant move by Nike. Who buys Nike? Mostly younger people, far more apt to be liberal & hold views aligned with scum like Colon Cowardnick. Most of us outraged weren't buying Nike.
Love a good boycott, this / is hilarious! Thousands of idiots burning their own stuff because they completely missed the point!
Sooo you're outraged at the Nike Deal but accept everything that tRump do?! And you say America is great? Fake outrage by all these racist idots just like their massa ! To all fake accounts and bots, no need to respond.
should have happened a long time ago for not having any shoe factory's in the whole of the US.
So now those who don't usually wear shoes are going to boycott a shoe company? Riiight. If Nike made trailers and overalls, this could hurt them. But...
Had these for too long to just throw them away. There's no way I'm boycotting
The good thing about is that he is giving us many ways out of this dilemma Mohammed Ali explained in this video

Oh for all you people burning Nike shoes, clothes, socks, etc... Wtf is wrong with you? Give em to GOOD WILL there are homeless people who can USE IT! So yeah don't burn the stuff just give it away to the less fortunate and more needy. Thanks for listening
Brennan: liberal moonbat moron, same as Kaepernick who's nothing but a disrespectful punk. You can't even spell HONOR you creep.
This is about all can land...And no the isn't colluding against you, you just can't cut it in the NFL
What Colin new shoes gonna look like? Cause Im gonna keep buying regardless.
Please stop asking those participating in this boycott to donate their Nike items to VETERANS in need. These are the same people who supported when he SEPARATED CHILDREN FROM THEIR MOTHER'S. They're void of decency, in short, STOP THEY DO NOT CARE.
Your President thinks the US flag has blue stripes but yeah, Colin Kaepernick is the problem.
Watching this like I thought use libs were supposed to be the snowflakes. I Imagine the trumpkins are too dense to get the irony here.
well if the Nike Child labor practices wasn't enough maybe Hiring this idiot will be enough to bankrupt this ridiculous company!
I dont even like these shoes that much, but in light of the directed at the ad campaign, and with full support from Lexi the Dog, Im damn sure rockin em today.
So people are burning and cutting holes into their Nikes to support veteran's?You know what would be better?Donating your shoes,socks and shirts to homeless veteran's and homeless people in general.But whatever.Keep owning libs...

Burn all your clothing and accessories instead of donating them to the veterans who you are supposedly supporting with the . Geniuses. No wonder you voted for .
Oh. So they mad? . STAY MAD. Theyre used to cutting holes in garments and setting fires for black people anyway. Obviously. At least this time itll cost them a pretty penny.
Trumpites destroy their own stuff to spite .Just like they vote against their own best interests in order to spite others.They sound like real "stable geniuses."
Just wondering - and I know my opinion doesn't matter because I'm Canadian - but instead of burning your shoes and cutting out logos why can't you donate that stuff to someone who actually needs it and would be happy to actually have shoes?
Just Do It

Just for the record, when honoring God in church, we take a knee. We dont stand. You could argue that Kaep is more respectful to the flag than those standing.

Welp, it's official, I will never buy anything from Nike ever again. I like under armour and Asics better anyway. Shame on Nike; they really should have picked a better person for such a role. They will lose a LOT of business I'm sure.
Rebels with a cause For all my days on this Earth Americans have romanticized the Rebels (Ex: Apple/Amazon)
If I cared about Nike's advertising, I would have stopped years ago when they used Spike Lee. They can hire a washed up QB to pander to kids who don't know better. Wearing my Jordans today.
The only form of I find acceptable. Otherwise, donate that shit to the numerous vet organizations for disabled or homeless vets, idiots.

I have friends who sacrificed everything for what they believed. You sacrificed millions but dont oversell. lost one customer for trivializing my brothers in blue sacrifice.
Just wondering why all these so called patriots who are mad at Nike that are burning these old monarchs dont show their faces?
Dear , Do better! Sincerely, Colin KaepernickJust doing it.
Wow, this is really exposing America's true colors and how divided we really are. I understand both sides of the argument but objectively wouldn't you want to side with the company trying to bring us closer together and end systemic racism? Just a thought.
wasnt a big Nike fan anyway it didnt make since paying more just for the brand. But will make sure I continue to avoid the product.

Using the slogan "Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything" to describe a millionaire athlete who lost literally nothing when he refused to stand for a flag that represents millions of soldiers who have actually lost EVERYTHING...
Underestimates the American people and is willing to lose customers by signing a 2nd rate football player and making him a thing. I am done and will NEVER buy Nike again. If was a better player hed still be playing
Are people seriously calling for a because theyre supporting Colin Kaepernick? If you boycott , then look at yourself as part of the problem
We aint supporting Nike til Kentucky Basketball Season. Go Cats!
make me LMFAO has rappers payroll who support Kap + I rock them yo
forgets:The last 3 seasons that Colin played his franchise was in disarray. Harbaugh bolted. Tomsula failed. Chip Kelly was a nightmare. And talent was running for the door. Kap lost his job because he knelt.
Wow what'a move by . As a data geek I would love to have seen the data behind their move. Is it a next-gen play? Dont think Trumpers are a big fitness market? Or they just wanted to stand for something they believe in?
Then go buy your trainers in Russia. Then try criticizing police brutality there or try criticizing anything!If you cant handle respectful kneeling, you belong there.
I used to be a boycotter until i realized if i boycott every company i am against, i would be living in a cardboard box with no food, no clothes, no life. Nike sucks but so does walmart, target, covergirl, tylenol, etc. Where does it end???
Even if you stand with rest of us we will just do it. Boycott the nation too if you feel like
just messed up big time. Depicting someone who plays the victim card as an "Hero" ? Not acceptable!
Not sure why we need to destroy our Nikes, just wear them for a week and they fall apart by themselves.
Coming from a Business side of life I cant comprehend why a Publicity traded company would play Russian Roulette with their stock & run the risk of driving the share price down so it tells me their leadership the top are foolish decision makers.
"Unpatriotic" vs "Nike taking a stand"(?) Money is... Losses from vs. Gaines from consumers in emerging markets MEA, Asia, Americas/Carib, plus conscious white folk in Germany:)
I'm was a huge Nike customer. No longer!

A lot of these people supporting a , are going to be in a real bind when the school of their kid has a Nike contract for their athletic uniforms. Are they going to tell their kid that they can't play that sport, because the school makes them wear Nike?
This is great. Now if we can just get all other shoe companies to come out in support of a black NFL player, we'll be able to tell who the bigots are just by looking at their Fred Flintstone feet.
I planted a corn hybrid once that was a yield monster. Problem was it busted off about knee high at harvest. Didnt fit in my operation without the complete package.
I agree wholeheartedly with what John Brennan said. I support you 100%
...No. Just Drop It.
the only people boycotting are racist, triggered, and immature pricks plain and simple. People who can't stand someone standing up against racial injustice.
Dear patriots, first of all you dont get to speak for all veterans. And Nike already has your money. Youre just burning your own property. Idiots.
tbh I dont fully understand. is fighting for issues like police brutality and racial injustice. Which is a good thing because its yet to be solved or achieved in 2018. But apparently Im misunderstanding something.
To those cutting up and burning their nikes . Why not donate them ? you dont agree with Nike , & feel that kneeling disrespects vets. why not turn your energy and $ towards orgs that support us? They will take your nikes, coins and put them to good use
Any IDIOT who burns or cuts up their Nike products, are Stupid, Mindless, and Racist.. and Support Police Brutality.. and Letting that (Circus Peanut) Guy in the White House, influence you.. Im with Kaepernick, and what he stands for forever ....-Not Me
Black folks know what burning signifies: whites have been burning black Churches to terrorize us since Reconstruction. So if you think tossing a pair of Nikes into a fire is going to scare us, we still know
Most muslims don't like to stand for our Anthem because it represents our Fallen Soldiers whom they show nothing but disrespect for. Should've been a lesson we don't diss Cops or the Fallen Soldiers!
The people that want the because of Colin Kaepernick wear trainers like this anyway...
Anyone is Wyoming or Idaho (or any of those nowhere places) tweeting about cutting their logo off is ridiculous - you dont set culture ANYWHERE LOL
your key man now ,after distroying football now he will cost you a lot of bus.colin k. you should rewind on that thought of your non american product. plenty of sneekers for colin k.
Its also important to note, I havent seen one tweet on that is someone actually boycotting. Its all just sane people pointing out how stupid this boycott is
I just retired after 21 yrs in the Army. STOP USING US to push your racist agenda. is bringing light to an important issue that likely has never affected you. It is more disrespectful to us that you keep spewing this garbage. Stop.
Hey , when two of the most despicable human beings on the planet champion your cause, maybe its time to find another cause.
This thing. I don't wear Nike because of a boycott, I don't wear them because I'm a Podiatry Nurse and they suck for your feet. Asics, Brooks, New Balance and Skechers FTW!!!
People would rather burn their Nike gear to support veterans than donate them to Veteran support organizations. WTF
Was a loyal customer for 40 years. But I will NEVER EVER buy anything Nike ever again!
Veterans are homeless and battered women and children exist specifically because of the people that participate in . Why would they do something about the thing they created and take pride in?
People need to stop bashing one another. If Nike were to use Trump in that ad which would be fucking hilarious, Liberals would be doing the same, cutting off the swooshes point is its just a damn brand. Relax. Wearing it doesnt mean you believe in what they do.
To all these Trump supporters burning your Nikes, go ahead because it's hard to get that mothball smell out of them.
So now all of a sudden y'all mad at ?..but probably never once stood up for any kind of injustice..this world is so fucked up..we all have issues but y'all pointing all your hate in the wrong direction and/or purpose....mad at them concessions too?
If you are cutting your Nike swooshes off of your clothing because they made an ad with someone you dislike/disagree with, you are the problem.
To be upset that people are deciding to boycott Nike due to them supporting Colin Kaepernick is the equivalent of people being upset that Nike is supporting. These are all opinions and beliefs and we all deserve to have one.
Racist people boycotting is the best ever... this finally unearth the garbage that support donald trump and other racist movements
Way to support a thug promoting anti cop and antilaw sentiment
Im not getting into the debate of standing/ kneeling for flag here but the sacrifice everything part of Nike slogan is pretty ridiculous. Colin Kaepernick
Wait wait wait before anyone wanna get rid of your send them to my house I can send to some kids in Africa that will appreciates some footwear
When you dumbasses torch the Nikes that you already paid for, make sure you burn even more of your money by throwing in your Converse and Hurley gear. All the same company. We'll be over here laughing.
"White people"? THAT is the real problem here. When you stop spewing BULLSHIT about people who do not look like you, you just might GROW UP!!!(Hear that, .?!)
FYI if you plan to ruin your Nike stuff because youre absolute trash give it to me because you dont deserve to wear it anyways
Dear President TrumpI'd engage in the , but I think Colin Kaepernick would make a better president than you.Sincerely,Jesus
Just an fyi to everyone participating in this boycott/product burning. Nike is worth billions. Have a good day!
So, Americans are destroying their Nike products because a black man with an opinion is fronting the brand's new marketing campaign? 'Murica in 2018 everyone...
Those on never call out police brutality. Its as if they support it because they do.
Can we start already? I'm tired of seeing idiots being more stupid than usual.

Hey if your shoes are made in the US, now would be a good time to capitalize on the slogan that I thought up this morning. "Made in America for Americans".
Anyone who thinks cares about this stupid is so delusional and knows nothing about Nikes core buyers
I just saw a pair of Nikes thrown over a power line in a neighborhood Im not comfortable in.
This is pretty straightforward. It's just an anti-Trump political statement. Nike is just saying that they're not interested in serving half of the population. If you're Anti-Cop you just found your brand.
Support the Troops Adidas. Buy Under Amour!
2. A true leader will meet with other leaders and have a dialogue. Just forcing the hate back does not accomplish anything.
No other running shoes compare to my Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 33s.Might take the opportunity to buy another pair now
Yes... burn your shoes so you can continue to ignore the glaring racial injustice and inequality problem
If youre supporting the youre an idiot.
Glad people are finally boycotting Nike for their egregious abuse of under paid sweatshop wor- Wait, this is about Football again isn't it?
can we get a tariff on any nike product made outside of the US (hint, hint, that's ALL of them)That's how ya deal with upity corporations in America these days!
I hate seeing dusty hillbillies in Nikes anyway. Its not for yall!

Let me know when Kaepernick sacrifices everything... and just an FYI just because I disagree with Kaepernick doesn't mean I'm going to destroy my Nike stuff. But this picture speaks louder than words.
Normally I wouldnt care about a companies advertising, but the slogan/campaign is NOT honorable, NOT supporting black lives, or America
If youre mad about and the Just Do It campaign and you feel the need to burn your stuff...Donate it! Then when you realize youre an IDIOT at least youll have something to feel decent about.
Does the mean that all conservative college football fans have to stop supporting their schools that are signed with
is a good dude, doing a lot of great work. This is hilarious, couple of idiots burning their shoes will not hurt the company.
Due to your support of Colin Kaepernick I will no longer buy any of your products nor will any of my family and friends
Nike just lost A LOT of money
Apparently I have always boycotted because I have never put a pair of Nike's on my feet and now I NEVER will!
We will be looking elsewhere for sporting goods, along with thousands of others. Hope its worth it Nike, you made your bed.
been a customer since my mama was buying my stuff; they aint perfect but they have consistent core beliefs that athletes are individuals who should be recognized for on and off court contributions. thank you!
lol, did Russia come up with this?
Just Don't Buy It !!!
No more swoosh in this house. Unbelievable slap to our flag, our Veterans and most Americans. We should all work together and assist NIKE in their brand Suicide. PLEASE REYWEET TO YOUR FAMILY.
Maybe I'd be willing to find the funny if it wasn't so damn scary. I can't imagine hating someone so much that you're willing to burn your own possessions. Laugh now, but just remember these are the same people who will be lining up to vote this fall.
Hey I just sawed off my own feet to crush the libs.
Hey, you people participating in the - already has your money. Hundreds of thousands of people would be happy to have clothes and shoes that aren't already falling apart. If you no longer want products, donate them!
For anyone who decides to participate in the by burning/destroying your apparel. Just send em my way, I know groups that send clothes and shoes to children and families in need.
I support my police all the way!You folks are so done! You WILL LOSE.....Watch & see!
Just be a traitor !!Just hate America !!just hate police!! just trample on American the flag !just hate !!just wear police pig socks !!just hate white people !!Nike you just lost Nike youre done Phil Knight its over
I will stay in this country to fight justice. I will not leave this country just so yall can win. Black people will not stay silent, we will speak out against racism in this country.
What isnt a disgrace, is a black man exercising his liberties that were fought for by veterans. You guys are just mad because you want black people to shut up and stay where you tell them to. Its a new era, America. Wake the fuck up!
All you have is a pair of socks to destroy for the how will they ever survive w/o your support lmaooo
Good job, You've pissed off the majority of your customer base. Non-liberals/Patriots are statistically proven to be more engaged in sports. I will never buy your products again. You will suffer the consequences of this vile decision you have foolishly made.
yes, all 4 sec...? don't blame us, it's your videonow answer my question!"How does / harm anyone?" please answer?= a week, you'll go 'buy' new Gear
another poor decision by a corporation to push their agenda
I fully support and 100% and against the
Nike just lost my business!
didn't just fail at , but now he fails as spokesman.First time company signs a communist & loses $38M within hours.
The fact that & are both trending shows you where the state of our country is...
surprisingly, those who are spreading nonsense have never bought any original nike product always wearing chinese knockoffs... its none of my business tho"...... follow me let us twerk,
Obviously its all wypipo that are apart of this boycott, all I see is pointed white hoods with a see thru front cover, BC WE CAN SEE U CRACKAS FOR DA KKK KLOWNS YOU ARE...FUCK
New balance is a fantastic company. Much smarter CEO. Just a dolt Collin and the dolt that runs Nike just ruined the company. Americans like winners. The Iranian Presidentis wrong. is a loser. Not even close to one of our bests QBs. What a joke!
Just DONT do it. Done with
Cletus from bum fuck Idaho just tweeted the same guy who thinks flip flops are formal
They desperately want to change the narrative to the military so they won't have to admit there's injustice in the U.S.
- Prison labor is a billion-dollar industry, with uncertain returns for inmates - Don't forget about the issue of abusing poverty-stricken workers abroad.
ALL POLICE OFFICERS be careful responding to alarm at nike stores take care driving there don't hurry and be ready for possible ambush and dont forget your break
This white supremacists are so heartless I mean the fact that they would burn their shoes and clothes rather than donate them to a local church, Salvation Army or Goodwill store shows just how self absorbed, uncaring and ignorant they are
For those of you using as a way to overshadow because you love the military so much, Tillmans mother specifically asked not do that. And since you respect the military SO much, thought I would let you know. Youre welcome.
I do homeless outreach. We could use those shoes, shirts, shorts and socks youre destroying....
You really missed a great opportunity to show your country your patriotism! Instead, you chose to show your lack of!
So if someone makes an American flag using clothes, would a Conservative burn and destroy that flag?
1. I will not burning my Nike shit, I will just switch to buying Adidas or Reebok. Colin thinks he is helping his cause, he is not because everyone is still on the same side of their argument. A true leader will find a way to change minds.
will work like every other conservatives boycott. For every burned pair of $40 shoes bought on a clearance, Nike will sell five new Air Jordan and their new Kaepernick line. The big brands knows their customers, it ain't Trump voters.
and therefore anything said against their arguments is pro-racism is fucking idiotic and contributes to an atmosphere of division in much the same way it did during the 2016 election. I hate people, and thats all I have to say on the lol
Are You Still Going To Support Nike After Making Kaepernick The Face of the Just Do It Campaign?
All of the redneck bigots and Trump voters are in their feeling because is standing with Kap in his fight against police brutalityBe aware mtgs are dress code enforced
I boycott Nike because of their history of child labor. The disgusting, inhumane working conditions this company adopts is no secret. It's insane to me more people are bothered by KAP than this huge corporation's exploitation of the poor
The will put thousands of children out of work. Think about the children, they need jobs too.
Fucking idiot supporters.
*Nike "employes" underage children making them work with a non-existent wage. Woke peopleZ - .........*Nike gets some dude to advertise their productWoke peepz - ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING BEHAVIOUR HOW CAN ANYBODY SUPPORT THIS BOYCOTT NIKE AND BURN ITTTT!!!!
Watch and maybe you'll understand why people like . It's not about you this time. Maybe think outside of yourself for half a second. I proudly support and their new campaign.
Because racist scumbags are dumb.
This country is really on some bullshit. All the silent KKK members are angry and loud now and are now exposing themselves to us in true fashion
For anyone who truly thinks gives a fuck that you are burning PURCHASED product or the to try to hurt their stock value (that is global btw) because of yall are truly dumb lol
Using your platform to bring attention to an issue that you're passionate about, knowing it will be unpopular, is so much more patriotic than throwing away a pair of socks.
Is JB also endorsing child labor, slave wages, and arbitrary abuse at ?
So the new just means
I wonder what % of Nike's business is international? Nobody here cares about the . Not even those who might sympathize w/rednecks (if they followed a marginal sport like American football). Do the people boycotting really think they are hurting Nike's sales or brand?
they are in the trash can along with the at my house
If you're destroying your own shit in "support" of vets during this but not ACTUALLY doing the ground work to help the thousands that are homeless and millions that are struggling you're probably a white supremacist...
wait you buying Nike products to burn them, is Nike refunding your money, where have we seen this before,hmm, Cleveland then dumb fouls bought the shirts again. Insanity is when you keep doing the same thing and expecting different results.
Even though I don't "stand with Kaepernick" I'm not about to destroy my Nike stuff lol that's just doing to much.
Talk about a marketing opportunity for Addidas, Reebok, Puma, etc. This is their New Coke moment...lets see who strikes first.
Never been much into labels. I bought these last year because they were on sale, in my size, comfortable, well made, and my favorite color. I like them very much. Now - I think I love them.
Just bought my last pair of Nike shoes.
So how has any of the injustice gotten better in the last two years? Good for Colin though getting paid, bad for average people that are just trying to get along with each other
Smart move I dont usually like your stuff but now I want to buy it! Love the ad campaign and the message
One day my grandkids will ask me, What is privilege? I will say, burning athletic gear that most people cant afford because your wife is having an affair with the pool man and youre angry.
I bet if Adidas promoted something with Luis Suarez on it and it be similar to his past no one would say shit (this is just an example so calm now )
So, yall "stand for the flaggers" going to stand for what you believe in and boycott the NFL? I mean all the uniforms and shoes are Nike. Even the Jerseys you buy are Nike... or is it not that important anymore? Just curious?!!!
nike was still made in america and then went to China etc. Then we should boycott, but now your doing it because they're endorsing a former player that's trying to make a difference.
Just when I'm about to buy a new pair of runners (or, actually walkers... I don't run anymore) from Saucony I find there's a so I'm going to buy a couple pair of Nike walkers....
has a domino affect! will get richer & pay and other Black & White athletes to make more ads. Trump supporters will be consumed by their hate and all turn into butter! I'm here for this 100%
Good luck with the 'boycaught' uned trumpers...you're hilarious!
And because of this I can tell that the white people that are doing this are Trump supporters.
I did it a long time ago when I was aware of them using child labor and abuse of employees in their Converse factories.
Maybe Trump supporters would prefer shoes with a Swastika logo?
People Ive said this before. Stop the boycotts. They are disingenuous, pointless, and largely ineffective. If you dont like Nike, dont buy it. But stop looking to make a statement by burning your clothes on social media. Donate them.
Nike will go down just like the NFL went down !!!
those burning or trashing their Nike apparel rather then donating just goes to prove how spoiled, selfish, and hateful these people are.
I use to work at a retail store. To the small populus of confused, brainwashed, and ignorant white privileged folks out there saying is disrespecting the flag & vets, gives vets 35% off of their purchase. Still tho?
They will now. They just sacrificed a huge market share and many loyal customers.
The left wants no one to respect the flag bc they don't want us to be proud of our country and if we r not proud then no one will fight for it.
I'm no fan of Kat von D's anti-vax beliefs, but I'm not going to destroy expensive makeup because of it. I'll donate what I can. I don't understand destroying something you already paid for. It only hurts you.
Just Do It Marine
Flag over Country? What does that mean?GO ahead Sweetie fall in line - Sean Hannity creates a diversion on the eve of the illegitimate hearing for SCOTUS covering for the criminal enterprise of trump admin and GOP Kids & teams all over the US are still buying Nikes
Obviously Michigan has Jordan gear, but it's unclear if that will escape the because it doesn't have a swoosh on it
I wonder how many people are going to destroy their Nike merch before they realize Nike is not going to be affected at all bcuz they already got your money! And its just a stupid reason to destroy your own shit! is dumb af.
supporting Kaepernick and their stance for equality and brotherhood is the main reason why they are my favorite global brand. racists gonna racists.
So instead of burning ya'll shoes why don't you just donate them to a person in need? Ppl are so dumb I tell ya
- is whats wrong with social media & the climate of politics. If people want to boycott for being the face of a marketing campaign, fine. But for people to destroy each other over a difference of opinion will never help heal.
I support
I have never owned a pair of shoes in my life. I will happily buy a pair now to counter this bullshit . I proudly support
Just go ahead and do it. Because all your other boycotts worked out so well...
So sad that NFL players decided to abuse their public exposure to promote a political agenda. Equally sad that NIKE's sports marketing dept couldn't appreciate that celebrity endorsements need careful evaluation of the benefits to promotion
Instead of cutting and burning y'all Nike products, maybe y'all should give them away to homeless veterans since y'all claim to care about the so much, but y'all don't really care about them. Y'all just really hate black people for no reason
People are really using because of the Colin Kapernick ad... We need to rethink our priorities. We should be boycotting Nike for their pathetic SNKRS platform and the amount of Ls we have all taken on every hyped sneaker release!
Just remember this Thursday through Monday when your favorite team is on. Ill bet Nike makes their stuff. Good luck watching sports . P.S. Nike will be just fine without yall! Trust me they make billions
Im surprised these folks havent given up fresh air since Colin Kaepernick breathes it too. Theres more rage shown towards him than rampant injustice
Hitler sacrificed everything because he believed in something.Just because you sacrifice for what you believe, doesn't make what you believe good or even accurate.
I didnt see this energy when potus was disrespecting the military, POWs and gold families
isn't about Kaepernick. It's about the tone deaf, virtue signalling message, saying he "sacrificed" something is ridiculous. He was an average player who drew a media circus, then mocked police officers and Cubans with his antics.
Did you know that Nike indirectly controls the production and sale of 99% of US seatbelts? Also all heart medication.
To those fuming at Nike & using their big yaps to threaten please keep posting about it so I can make a list & check you off, one by one, as I buy more products. Thx.
So does this mean yall boycotting the NFL as well because every team jersey is made by Nike?
interesting enough this is trending because Liberals are tweeting about how upset they are this is trending.
Lets boycott a company because one of their clients sacrificed his career to bring attention to social issues. Makes sense.
Americans must be the dumbest people around here...they be boycotting Nike products by burning them... Like Nike ain't making no single loss from that... You bought shit yourself.. The money went straight to nike... Lmao
is official will NOT be getting a penny from me! So many other good quality athletes with good morals and they decide to pick this who supports violence against those who protects us, someone who wore pig socks depicting police officers
Kapernick pussywhipped by radicalized girlfriend!Nike pussywhipped by radicalized consumers
How come it's only white people who are pushing the ?
like Kaepernick is one of those supposed low genius-level football players whose Wonderlic score was attained by someone else (someone of legitimately high intelligence). (If his IQ is a nickel above 90, I'm a Chinaman.) (Intertel calls 38 ~= IQ 135.)
You want to do something simple to show your support for America's police officers?Trash any Nike gear you have and commit to boycotting them for life.It's easy...Do It.
makes over a billion dollars a year in China alone. Theyre a global company. Theyll be fine. Just like and didnt go bankrupt when everyone decided to them.
you ask? Because Nike agrees with this sentiment. Never another dime.
There are impoverished people all around the world that could use the shoes youre burning.
this is So Sad it just proove racism still living i sense a WorldWar3 soon !!!!!
Liberals: Giant multinational corporations are evil. They exploit their workers, while paying their executives millions. Same Liberal: Buys Nike products on their IPhone Amazon app as a way to Me: Your is fake AF.
My family and I support all Law Enforcement. We have spent so much money on your products. You've split our Country! Officer Cooper in Covington, Georgia was shot last night. Do you even feel even a touch of guilt? You should...
My thoughts go out to all the people who work at a Nike store and are about to deal with old racist folk bumbling in for the first time to shout about how Nike just lost a long-time customer who totally spent like, SO much money there.
Folks throwing away their Nikes for what now??? Huh?? GEESH..people... yall really have got to get your racism together!! Its so obvious a blind man can see it!! Meanwhile 45 didnt want to lower the flag for a REAL LIFE VETERAN HERO! RIP John McCain!!
how does burning your shit own a lib? I don't get give 2 shits if you burn your shit? You want to be stupid enough to burn your shit, burn your shit. As for Nike just as many people will now go buy as don't. Just like Keurig Starbucks they will be just fine.
" chose to use his visibility and platform to actually give a damn and to speak into something far more important than games. Crucifying him for this, is missing the point of this country spectacularly."
NO Trump only nominated for scotus b/c said s/d b exempt from civil suits,criminal investigations &criminal prosecutions &Trump need protection from all these crimes. Judiciary committee GOP hiding papers
This month its my birthday. I wanted a new wedding ring but now I just want a full Nike outfit and shoes!! You have my support 4life
I don't buy Nike because sweatshops. And while I support It doesn't change my mind.Nike is not a role model company. is also dumb.
Lol maybe Nike wanted to get their logo and brand off trump supporters. And racists. is dumb
Trump supporters are RACIST, DUMB, ANTI AMERICAN BIGOTS..WHO think burning shoes they ALREADY have is going to make a difference
Bwhwha, this is hilarious. The uneds 'boycotting' again, yeah, good luck w/that. What exactly r u boycotting; most certain most of u uneds are poor and overweight, having no need or even monetary means for nike products. go back to smashing ur coffee makers.
you wont see this but in case you do Nike supports shooting police because a millionaire feels shafted by the NFL. Great move Nike
I find it ironic that once conservatives (heck, not even conservatives just people who stand for the anthem) do a boycott ( ) that it's "idiotic" and "racist"Yet, those people probably supported other boycotts just for companies having certain political views
Those supporting the boycott of , Are also Supporting the Injustice of Police Brutality of Unarmed Men/Women/Children! You Support the Killings of Innocent People! Do Your Research...
Think abt why YOU are supporting a . Cause a black man risked his livelihood to bring awareness to police brutality, murders of POC including children, inspired us to speak up then rewarded that strength of character.
What is this stupid trend just because chose someone to be the face of something wow seeing as no other has said it a very happy anniversary to the best brand in the world Nike
If you dont want your Nike clothes anymore donate them to homeless veterans & the working poor military they could use them and that would Show your true patriotism
We salute you, ! We stand with you as we have stood with ! And to the brilliant patriots who are destroying shoes/products you already purchased  you could give them to any one of the millions of homeless United States VETERANS! Carry on.
Boycott culture is honestly ridiculous.
A) black people are the biggest consumers in America and yall think we aren't gonna support NIKE when they're supporting Kaepernick lol B) Nike doesnt just sell in America so....have fun burning things u already paid for
I love laughing at all the racist dumb asses that started . These people are just sad uneducated racist
Busy Tuesday! hearings preview, follows absurd tribute, flag uproar, eulogies attack ... click listen live NOW at
Good-morning ! , let's & !The Ferguson of , NEVER HAPPENED! 6 HONEST witnesses said Mike Brown attacked the Cop.
Burning your NIKE but have Zero Active deployment duty, campaign medals or wounds means you are just followers Vet here & I sport my NIKE daily
This is hilarious (in a totally racist way). truly are overly sensitive!
I just gave $10 this weekend to a homeless veteran. Instead of burning your Nike gear like a goddamned idiot, donate it to homeless veterans. They would love to wear it.
If you see any naked runners on your morning jog with their hair on fire, dont worry...its just Trump supporters who ripped their Nike running cloths off because of this.
People who dont usually buy saying they will boycott them is like me telling a famous model Ive never dated, I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!
love how a VAST majority of the backlash are from white people thus proving YOU ARE FUCKING RACIST.
Anyone who is participating in the can DONATE all their Nike attire my way, instead of burning it i'll put it to good use
Which side of history you want to be on? Nike supporting black athletes or adidas loving self hating black people. Ill take support Nike anyday.
Im going to go buy a pair of Nikes just to spite you bitter bitches.
NikeJust Do it
Mom loves to run in her Pegasus shoes. She loves them even more now! Shell be doing opposite of the
so nike just release the new colin kaepernick line.Its called..."Amercian cancer series"1st shoe is released today.The Michael brown
After releasing their new ad campaign as a company just became even more of a joke to me than they were before. Also this stuff is stupid, donate your clothes to ppl in need. Dont destroy them.
If you strongly support , why not pay back forward  by not buying instead of destroying your own stuff?
JUST DO IT...
I'm seriously disappointed in the lack of product burning videos. C'mon people, how else are you gonna express your ? , burn your shit that you paid for. Or you can just give it to the goodwill.
WOW where was the when we found out that your $200 kicks were being made by people paid less than $1 a day?Why do I wear Nike? Because Adidas and Puma don't make shoes my size and I rarely find Reebok. I have massive feet.Love your work and
Companies that use 'Caleb's for PR always & eventually end up eating it - either in terms of unrecuperated ROI and/or on crisis mgmt intervention (in Mktg/PR depts). Trust.Karma works universally. will never ultimately be rewarded for being dumb.
I agree but I have to say my started when I saw how poorly made the shoes were. I had to wear arch supports until I found better shoes.
Just ordered some Air Max 270s to burn them but fr, y'all dumb af if you're gonna destroy shit you paid for I'm finna get my money's worth. But hey, to each their own
People are ridiculous
The , who left Reebok to use Nike jerseys, must have had a helluva phone call with their CMO this weekend
So I see y'all boycotting Nike n destroying ur Nike stuff but like?? If ur going to stop wearing the brand because of ur beliefs then you do you but they already got ur $$ wanna donate ur clothes to people in need instead?? Y'all aren't doing anyone any good rn
Just the beginning...these idiots deserve all the punishment they have coming...
Umm just a thought.....instead of destroying what you already paid for why dont you donate overpriced merchandise like Nike to kids in need. Then boycott Nike by not buying the product.
The same people burning their jersey and nike gear, are the same people who dragged an American War Hero John McCain. They have lost all credibility when it comes to the national anthem, or standing for the flag. The man wasn't even in the grave yet.
Im going to hold a a massive Nike burning if anyone wants to include their merchandise. Asking specifically for vintage Air Force or Jordan 11s in size 12 and workout gear in L or XL. New or lightly used preferred. I'm told they burn the best.
I guess donating your Nike gear to the veterans you pretend to care about makes too much sense? Nah, just rip it up instead. Thatll show them.
Here we have of showing his respect for the flag by wearing it as a garment in clear defiance of 4 U.S. Code ¬ß 8 - Respect for flag The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.
DONT JUST DONT
Just look who is supporting these idiots, tells you all you need to know. Colin Kaepernick earns support from diverse chorus, including John Brennan, over Nike ad
When the FUCK is Colin Kaepernick going to speak out about the use of child labor in Nike sweatshops???!
Dear Trump supporters,You know damn well you dont buy Nikes. Or athletic gear in general. Just stop pouting. Thanks.Sincerely,The ones YOU call snowflakes
I just drew a Nike logo on my dollar store socks with a sharpie
What once use to a beacon and power of enlightened understanding, it got betrayed and corrupted by the influence of superstitious prejudice, bigotry, fabricated lies, fear,... way to go Trump, hope you're happy and make lots of money in the end.
Exactly, because the is stupid
boycott ! Maybe the surplus in shoes will drop the prices and I can get my new running pair at a discount!!!
Liberals, we can support Nike today; order a new pair of Nike's; you can always use a new pair of sneaks. We either hang together or we hang separately. ;)
I just bought sneakers Sat....shipped yesterday....receive tomorrow...RETURN tomorrow
I understand and fully support the and to help all those outraged by Nikes support of Kaepernick, I will accept all Nike sneaker donations (size 10) and apparel (size large)
To all the simple minded racist "I'm not a racist I'm a proud American" white men...Stop comparing your "workplace" with the NFL...Not the same! Nobody cares if you quit or fired! You don't count...You can be replaced...No players...No league!See the difference!
If i didn't JUSTbuy two pairs of Nikes last week, I would have bought two more today
The is hilariously dumb. White people ruin everything, like always.
is the new face of the JustDoIt add for nike now ppl want to stage a
I haven't bought anything Nike since before Colin Kaepernick was born. I don't care about . I just don't waste my money on over-marketed, over-priced crap.
Just do THIS.
Just do it.
another racist filled day in America i support NIKE 100% and I will buy there products
I need to go to Foot Locker and buy all the Nike's I can find just so I can burn them!
Just woke up.Did Nike go bankrupt yet from all the cut out swooshes?
is flipping hilarious Id just like to take the time to personally thank you all individually for your collective outrage. Keep on burning those items youve paid for loooool
Please start the cause then in the shirts I really want Ill actually find my size
Those boycotting... I am sure you know the co founder of Nike is an Army Vet. Dont you support military owned businesses??
Dear been a loyal customer for a long time. Ill even share our 1st day of school picture....never again.
AMAZING:- Kaepernick KNEELS FOR ANTHEM BECAUSE HE IS MAD ABOUT THE 16 SHOOTING DEATHS OF UNARMED BLACK PEOPLE [not the 1000 aborted daily]- Denver offers him a job- He lies & saying no one will hire him- calls this "sacrificial" & "he gave up everything"
Nope. Just all the kneelers and their feigned outrage.
This thing is sounding as absurdly ridiculous as the conservatives getting pissed over NFL players taking a knee. Its like the conservatives and people for white supremacy have forgotten compassion and kindness for all and exchange it for bigotry and hate.
Burning my $140 sneakers in my dads $500 fire pit at our $650,000 house that no black people live near to own libs.
Just do it:
Nike boycotters, please keep this same energy and burn all and gear.
For all the people who have fake outrage over Nike working with and all of a sudden want to do this . How about you do something positive and give all your nike stuff to people in need i'm just saying.
You dont even need to sniff the racists. Theyre clear as day. I need me some Nikes, A cause for a new Chelsea jersey no doubt.
4% drop from previous highs
All of you stupid mfs who are destroying their gear just solidifies that you are a racist.
Is Nike creating jobs in the Black community in America? No. Nike is just taking money for rich white and Asian men by pandering to a precieved racial divide.
This is for all the you people are just choosing to stay unintelligent and uninformed
Dont want your sneaks because of a ? Why not donate them to someone in need. is looking to gather 320 pair of shoes for folks before the holidays. Much better way to dispose of your gear than throwing a temper tantrum on Snapchat.
for contact us: √© £„Éá„Ç£„É´ ¢Ë•øÁ©∫Ê∏Ø
boycott!!! I am a coach all my team had Nike gear not anymore! You have lost my business!!
Lets talk bravery in the Marketing Dept. There was also, one person, (I bet), in Nike marketing who sold the people upstairs on this idea. This Buds For You. You crazy person who shredded the box, instead of just going outside of it.
The ppl burning their Nike clothing are the same ppl that picked it up at the local goodwill. Salute to and
Wow, I have seen it all. People actually believe that there is no issue with social injustice. Once upon a time was thought to be a person pushing racist agenda, look how wrong those people were. This is America!
accused of fostering hostile workplace in new gender discrimination lawsuit. ¬†
The snowiest of flakes are mutilating their own property again. Go ahead.Just do it.
Are white people really that miserable.... shit is ridiculous you have a nice home...a great family... and everything you could ever want...but still hate exist in your life
Lets Just Do It !!
. Nike was my grandson's favorite brand, but this grandma won't be buying Nike for back-to-school or under the Christmas tree this year. Usually drop a lot of money every year on Nike. Won't support now.
Just say NO to
For the people that are doing the . You can just send me all your Nike apparel
All of the individuals participating in the will always be one minded because no matter how many times has stated why he kneeled...they never listened
This proves Colin point all along. The fact that ppl now are so mad they wanna boycott nike just shows how foolish people are. The "angry" whites are mad
I have always bought products, I will continue to buy them! Its funny to me that everyone is still missing the point of this fight. Social injustice is a real thing and sucks badly
I'm just here for the memes
yall just mad
I'm really not into Boycotts, but I am into choosing whom I buy from with my hard earned money. Nike definitely doesn't make the cut. If that is the same as a Boycott, oh well . . .
So let me get this straight you boycotted Nike because they sponsored a black man that is against police brutality I sense racism
Product boycotts almost never work. At 13, this was my first exposure to organized hate and hysteria. The focus was different, but hate is hate and I reject it with all my heart. I need shoes, and Im buying some Nike sneakers TODAY!
. . I guess forgot to add a clause!
I said it, i will say it again: Your Country is broken beyond repair...
The from Trump supporters is DOA.Reason?Nike went into this 100% aware that they would lose Trump supporter sales.They also knew that there were more of us than there are of them.After all, outside of Trump, who wants support from white supremacists anyways?
Back on Twitter after a weekend away to find out that the same people who say liberals get offended too easily are literally destroying their clothes/burning their shoes that they've already paid for because a black athlete appeared on one of their ads.
So let me get this straight, if you support you're a white supremacist & displaying white privilege?Talk about labeling someone. WOW.
Imagine destroying your own clothing because of a companies marketing campaign
Yep! Congratulations , you just lost me as a customer. engaged.Sorry - no new jersey or Nike tee for me this season, your sponsor fucked up big time.But maybe a tee from who hopefully has a wiser management than .
should all take a lesson from and take a knee to nike's manufacturing wages? like how the fuck is the whole family suppose to work at nike (children included) just afford bread to eat?
So are people whore participating in the just going to stop buying jerseys too? Or burn the ones they got?
Russian bot, trumps friends are pushing Nike Boycott, but this boycott will be as successful as the Star Wars & Black Panther Boycotts
The allowed Colin Kaepernick to do great damage to their brand.It is unbelievable that would do the same thing.For leftists, politics is more important than anything else.
Im Done!!!Not just doin it anymore!Love their merchandise but really?He should put $ where his kneeling is!Pathetic
Anyone that is for the supports the same injustice that was/is speaking out against. So hold this
I wrote a thing for the on the surprising, and somewhat morbid, origin story behind Nike's iconic "Just Do It" slogan. You'll find references to Colin Kaepernick, Gary Gilmore, and even Mars Blackmon.
When I was little kid my Dad used to shove Nikeshoes into my ass to punish me for sleeping with my neighbours dog. That's why I'm only buying ADIDAS products since I'm 18.Is that what this is about?
The just shows how racist America is...
you're destroying something you already paid for but sure... stick it to the man and all that shit instead of doing something useful like donating it
Imagine living in a place where you can simply burn, throw away your socks/shoes/clothing simply because you dont agree with business practices. Heh... get it together people! There are bisher issues at hands & to be outraged about....
This is hilarious. How has Colin Karpernick genuinely affected or hurt any of you? Serious question. I feel like you guys just like to jump on the bandwagon. Taking a knee started all of this. Taking a knee? Come on, yall!
Why in the hell would take a side, Flag over Country? And risk pissing off most of America. HORRIBLE BUSINESS DECISION. I have a nice collection of AirMax, sadly they wont worn anymore.
I support and I support during this ridiculous
It was nice of all the racists to use the same hashtag so we can see who they are.
When a cross isnt handy, just burn a sneaker.
Will this boycott have an impact on Nike sales. I vote no because black people are Nikes biggest supporter
The same people that are boycotting might as well boycott Oxygen ... PLEASE DO IT !!
So broke no law, no one was killed or injured all he did was speak up and use his platform to bring awareness to the killing of black and brown people by the hands of the police. So why are people wanting to boycott?
Would Nike EVER dare to support a conservative athlete like they are supporting , not for his on field stuff but for their activism?Never.
The same people supporting this ridiculous are the same people who defend White Supremacy and the Confederate Flag.
are you serious trumpets dont even wear Nikes ugh!!
Anyone that is mad about Kaepernick being part of Nike want to give out some Jordan shoes before burning them since people dont support Nike anymore I'm trying to get some nice Jordan 11's
It's a little hilarious seeing people post pictures of their clothes with the Nike swoosh cut out, as if these already purchased items are doing anything to Nike sales...
The people that started the hashtag are all Trump supporters and racist
At least supporters now have a hateful N-word of their own.
some people are boycotting because they supoort a black athlete how pathetic
Stick to the Kswiss and New Balances youre use to anyway. Boycott it... your kids will still buy them
The funniest thing happening on my TL rn: and "I'll just wear my Converse."Nike. Owns. Converse.
You can trust that has analyzed the potential business impact of its decision fifty ways to Sunday, and is not the least bit concerned about the .
Just donate your shoes to those in need.
Seems to me that a lot of people still want to ride with this whole being disrespectful to the flag propaganda and not focus on the real reason of his kneeling. Get out of your fucking feelings already....
no more Nike for me. Plus I coach HS basketball. I will be calling the adidas rep today to order my equipment for the 2018-2019 season
't "just do it"Do it better Asics!A real runner shoe!
I guarantee most people for the are ignorant on the topic and just want to hop on dicks because they see the hashtag with their counterparts tweeting about it.It's ALWAYS some monkey see, monkey do shit. Humans in general don't think, just follow the crowd. Smh
Nike really is on another level. They knew that they were gonna lose that Air Monarch business by releasing the Kaepernick ad. So what did they do? They rebranded the shoes as some hipster Dad shoes and opened up a whole new market. Chess not checkers.
What you SHOULDN'T be boycotting Nike for: Using Colin Kaepernick's situation to sell products. What you SHOULD be boycotting Nike for - their use of what amounts to slave labour in developing countries to make their products.
Time to throw-out my Nike's and never look back! When former Iranian Prez praises your company; you have hit a new low in being unamerican! How desperate NIKE must be to do something so stupid with Kaepernick.
I can't boycott products I don't use.
In today's attempt to distract from the criminal Trump & the hearings of illegitimate SCOTUS candidate Kavanaugh, we have morons crying for a
. JUST DO IT
if a man taking a knee during the singing of the national anthem is wrong how about selling beer during its rendition? not taking your hat off or how about just walking around the stadium?
Lets talk bravery in the Marketing Dept. There was also, one person, (I bet), in Nike marketing who sold the people upstairs on this idea. This Buds For You. You crazy person who shredded the box, instead of just going outside of it.
. saw declining attendance and TV ratings after Kaepernick ruined the game for fans, and thought to themselves: "Let's JUST DO IT!"
The good news for is that the won't effect them much. Nike isnt sold much so weren't their customer anyway. is the man!
Hey conservatives! Remember when you laughed at the liberals that got outraged over chickfila? Yeah, you look just as dumb now.
They can absorb that lost easily is built for sustainability & anyone that supports Colin Kilpatrick i'mma supportingPing &
Only reason I can think of to boycott Nike is because its so hard to find a 4E width!
Those darn white people. They just ruin everything. Shame shit different day.
White people love making shit what they want it to be. Some of you are Delusional. How many times can one tell you what something means before you stop sreading lies? THE Absolute definition of insanity..
What are your thoughts on Colin Kaepernick and the so-called ? Let us know...
I support our military and true heroes..
All these brigades, instead of burning them, can you please arrange for them to be dumped in . We will be very supportive of your boycott
There is plenty to criticize for - but I applaud them for this: 'Colin Kaepernick is the face of Nikes 30th anniversary ‚ÄòJust Do It campaign, and thats getting plenty of reaction' -
Me everyone supporting the
I remember back in the 80s when there was an outrage over Nike's CEO getting a $4 million bonus after closing American factories for Asian sweatshops. They were lead architects in the destruction of this country's economy; destroy them
Why are people saying donate your cloth to me eew whatever these people have may be contagious.
When people realize just ONE person in this world CAN determine what they will NOT be wearing.
Everyone on here for or against and please pray for the latest Police Officer that was shot in the head doing his job. Maybe focus on the black men, women & children killed daily in Chicago
was created by racist white folks/ trump supporters
The new face of Nike thinks police are pigs and murdered dictator Castro was great. JUST DONT
If this potential half fanbase believes the false ‚Äòdisrespecting the flag/vets/troops narrative, that Trump is spouting, theyre gullible af and Nike will survive without them. Just bought a new pair of ‚Äò97s too
I would participate in the ...But I don't have anything from Nike And I won't buy anything from Nike either. Because it's not my style.
Speaking of flop conservative boycotts just opened a merch shop by popular demand so be sure to get your official Red Hen shirt here
Nike already knew the type of customers it was going to lose and still made this decisionmeaning theyd rather sacrifice the money of racists for the greater good of their company
I don't support any kind of boycotts. Boycotts are absurd.I'd rather make a charity donation to the Nike Black American Stop The Chicago Violence Victims Fund...but oops
People are mad Kap is getting Nike money? Damn imagine how mad you would be if an NFL team paid him. I hope he wins that collusion lawsuit...
After a 28-20 loss against the Chicago Bears on Sept. 14 of 2015, Kapernick was fined $11,00 by the NFL for using a racial slur, f***ing n***a/er to be specific. Social injustice? He's part of the problem.
If people are going to then I expect them to not watch any Football or Basketball, support any of the players that they sponsored, go to any colleges that they support, buy or wear chucks or converses, etc. Oh wait, they wont....
Americans are WAY too patriotic.Your country really isn't that great.
hey trump supporters and conservatives you dont like and get over it these are the people who never sacrifice the better good of this country. They sit on the sideline while the troops are sent war over lie and defense industry
. What a mistake to become political. A sporting company should capitalize on this get a celebrity to push a sneaker.
Wait till Walmart has on its ads lol. What would they do next? Burn their whole house down...
The marketing guys at Nike are geniuses. In most cases, theres no such thing as bad publicity
Hate to break it to you, but rags still get used.
If you support Castro loving Cop hating Colin Kaepernick, don't call the cops when you need help. Go to your safe spaces and pound fucking sand. You're all being played by a charlatan and a company riding his SJW coattails.
Ill but not because of whats his face.. their shoes are crap and ugly. With so many shoes out there who cares what Nike does?  is better than Colin any day!
My washer and dryer must be really conservative because they have been tearing up my Nike stuff for years.
Wait..people are burning the Nike shoes they already own? you really showed them supporters
Imagine being so privileged that you are willing to destroy your own personal belongings to support police brutality, social injustice, classism, and racism. This is America. The rest of the world is literally laughing at you all.
The bots are trying to divide the USA again. BOYCOTT RUSSIA!
Goodness gracious! Yall really up for the over a black man trying to promote equality for people of color? Gosh. Whats more ridiculous things that conversations are going to do? I wouldnt want to count anyway.
And a purely personal note. It is humbling to see, a racism-oriented topic trending to number 1 on Twitter - and to find my own Tweet on top? And it wasn't even a joke Tweet but one I tried to be serious. Truly. Truly humbling. Am virtually taking a knee with players
Things Republicans have boycotted -Actors, tv shows, Hamilton, NFL, Keurig, musicians, Walmart, target, Nordstrom, Netflix, Starbucks, Pepsi, Nabisco, Macys, Amazon, Ben & Jerrys, Apple, FORD, AT&T, HSN, Bloomingdales and now NIKE. LOL These people are INSANE!
These same folks talking about also said boycott the NFL. That NFL boycott resulted in, well nothing. Most of the people that are boycotting Nike, well the MAGA people, dont realize how much Jordan, LeBron, KD, Kyrie product moves. Good luck burning your stuff!
forgets:The last 25 football games that Colin started - 4 Wins - 21 LossesOnly seven 49ers from 2016 are still employed by them. 7The coach- fired. He did not lose his job because he knelt.He lost his job because he's not good at it.
cant we all just get along.
Same people burning Nikes in the streets, are the same kind of folks who send out robo calls about . If youre going to boycott Nike, do it because of their sweatshops, not because someone stood up against racial injustice.
Isnt the 30th anniversary Nike slogan the same as the ISIS one
You've seen the people at these Trump rallies - do they look like Nike shoppers to you? Meanwhile, checking out the Nike shop and I like two hoodies and a pair of running shoes. It's my birthday month. I think I will just do it.
we are boycotting nike? can we get some shoes on ufc fighters? it's just an odd thing to see a grown ass man fighting with no shoes on?
The fact that is trending just shows it was never about him being a bad qb. Ridiculous
Conservatives never forget. Long after the "cause dejour" has disappeared from twitter.... conservatives will make financial decisions based on what they committ to today.
I've never bought their outrageously expensive shoes anyway, so I doubt they will notice my continued lack of doing so.
Imagine not buying shoes because of a football player not standing for a song.
Instead of you Idiots burning & cutting up your shoes & clothes why not do something useful like Donating them!
When the means there just might be more sneakers out there....
Hey ppl... This has a bonus prize...
Nah. I like Nike and will continue I support them despite what crying Trumptards say.
Just when I'm about to buy a new pair of runners (or, actually walkers... I don't run anymore) from Saucony I find there's a so I'm going to buy a couple pair of Nike walkers.
What's funny is the fact there a homeless veterans who fought against injustice and are living on their streets and they won't fight for them, but they want to say how is disrespecting them by standing behind who also is fighting for injustice.
Well, not with me ! I`m support and ! And by the way, don`t forget this: It wasn`t - NEVER - about the flag or the National Anthem !
Half the boycotters can only afford New Balance anyway. They're just using this as an excuse they can tell their friends for why they can't buy/afford the good stuff.
Nike should just trolls these dweebs by coming out with the Nike Boycott's a shoe with no Nike logo just a hashtag or perhaps just the word "Logo" in place of the Nike signage...
I hope all these Trump supporters burning their Nike sneakers have figured out an alternative to keep their cloven hooves comfy
Im convinced that only are partaking in this fake outrage I swear in a day or two theyre gonna be fake mad about something else... if only they spent the same energy being mad about racism and police brutality
Everyone thats screaming because Colin Kaepernick is disrespecting the anthem the flag and military veterans. How many of yall ever help the homeless veteran
Fuck the . I need a new pair of running shoes and Im just going to Do It.
Thats the thing. If I even remotely considered a , which I wouldnt because thats stupid and I love my AF1s, it would be over THIS
, its sad that companies that make $ millions off the working men and woman of this great nation cant stand up and support that same nation. TV stations wont show the National Anthem as its being played is just as despicable. Viewers and consumers will show you.
if yall stand behind Colin then I will not stand by you. He has disrespected our country, flag, and president.
Hey I decided to create my own campaign! Because I love my country!
Just imagine this whole kneeling thing was an accident and Colin just went with the publicity. He just kneeled down to tie his shoes and the media ran with a story.
This is my problem with the . You didn't boycott when they re-signed . Do you honestly feel what was doing was worse? Jesus. I'll always stand for Anthem but get some perspective here. Nike has hired some real POS in their day.
Black supremacist Tasheed will defend Kaepernick even though he supports Fidel Castro and who wears police are pig socks.
Im just here to laugh at the racists
Imagine being so racist that just a picture of a black guy makes you mad.
Not looking forward to a bunch of bare- chested-nipple-show'n-Trump-support'n-golf-play'n-middle management assholes walking around the office today.
EXACTLY!! Three twitter users are burning their 10 year old discount nike sweatbands and the over reporting in the media is making it seem like Nike should be actually be worried. Trust me, I'm sure Nike did the math.
My soccer player just ripped her Nike picture off her All About Me collage due at school today. Shes replacing it with . - you are not a brand or example for young athletes (or Americans) anymore!
...Because cutting the swoosh off your socks (that you already paid for) is really gonna show you mean business huh?? Well played Nike.
History will look fond upon and trust the process!
Am I going to go burn my familys Nikes? No. They cost good money my husband and I have worked hard for. But will I buy another pair? Again, the answer is no. Kap didnt sacrifice anything. He was a poor quarterback who couldnt get the job done.
Conservatives burning their Nike gear instead of just giving it away to a person in desperate need of the items they no longer want is the most conservative thing Ive ever seen.
Notice they waited till after kids went back to school because they knew it would hurt sales.
If y'all joining the and live in the Tampa Bay area, let me know ASAP.There's plenty of homeless people and less fortunate families that could use those Nike clothes that y'all plan on throwing out or burning.You can help others even with hate in your heart
Nike is unamerican .They are a hate company. They stand for division. They disrespect the flag, just like the Westboro Baptist Church. Nice! Kaeperdick
Before you Kaepernick haters boycott Nike, you might want to consider what snacks, drinks, hotels, movie theaters you spend money with every day in some form of fashion. You fools are helping us boycott the NFL with your hatred & you fail to realize it
There are Adidas and New Balance just to mention 2 other brands. So support the
I see is the number 1 trending topic this morning. So these idiots are destroying things they've already spent money on, instead of donating them to veterans or whomever, because they *checks notes* support the troops? Y'all are very much showing your ass.
That being said I don't agree with but that's probably because i've never really bought Nike i'm not going to spend 10x as much for something because it has a symbol on it and was made in a sweatshop.
Can yall just simply donate the damn Nikes.Geez! Smh.
Aren't RepubliCunts always laughing at boycotts because they don't work? And what they doing now?
I'm against boycotts because they don't work even though they get a lot of media attention. Still eating at In&Out.
I wore my usual Nike shoes to work but Im wearing Puma socks...
Hey lets boycott Nike but on Sunday lets go to a church (catholic) that supports the abuse of children. How many of those fake patriots stop and thank veterans for their service?
I wonder if the college game day crew is aware of your views on the social & racial injustice faced by black men at the hands of cops? Why dont you stick to music? you need to find another group for opening.
If you want to discuss sacrificing EVERYTHING. Lets remember what sacrificing EVERYTHING means. RT if you agree
I wonder if Collin Kaepernick cares that uses sweatshops to produce their apparel? I guess the oppressed workers are not all black so it doesnt fit his narrative.
white men just needed another excuse to burn something down that is used by black people.ChurchesSchoolsHospitals Businesses Nikes
I wonder how many of these people are even casual Nike customers.
Why are you assuming everyone taking place in the is white and/or a white supremacist? Thats just not fair. Tweets like this pull people further apart.
To all of you burning your Nike products... Thank goodness they don't build houses. Where the hell would you live then.
Amazing how liberals forget Nike's infamous reputation for using child labor and mistreating workers.
If you're not racist I challenge u to walk alone through a project in Chicago at night. Get back to me how kneeling 4 our flag & wearing socks depicting cops as pigs allows you to stand in a pulpit of b.s. if you survive it. & tell us how racist we r
Let's throw out, cut up, & burn all of our Nike apparel to "show support for America and the troops", and then go outside and step over the hungry, ill-clothed homeless vet who has been panhandling outside of our TV studio for weeks. 'Murica, fuck yeah!
Today in Im a stupid motherfuckernews, thousands of white asswipes burn their already purchased shoes and socks.
Amazed by the amount of so called patriots cutting up their Nike products because someone takes a knee in America, but those same people have no problem with taking a crap all over our country.
Well isn't that just special.... have a short to the point response American conservatives will no longer buy your products or watch sports teams that you sponsor Just saying...
No over here . People with sense & military folks can scream to these dummies that kneeling was never about disrespecting the flag ,military& vets. But the other side says but they are disrespecting the military.They just refuse to listen to the real issue!
Yo to the -ers can you hit me first before you burn your shoes? Disclaimer: it has to be in mint condition. I mean if you're just going throw away that good :) Much respect to and for the campaign.
Ive been on a for a minute. But thats cause Im team /// .
I should of been on this only because I took to many Ls on the snkrs app
folks boycotting Nike ain't shit. They'll keep a single pair of Nike's for 5 years.It's us Black & Brown folks that buy Nike's every other weekend.
So you've decided to take part in the over Colin (and not their labor practices before this or their outrageous prices). Let me give you a tip. Donate those shirts and shorts and socks and shoes. Give them to somebody homeless.
Let me guess we‚Äòre boycotting Nike because by them supporting Colin Kaepernick they are somehow disrespecting the flag. We all know this to be untrue/unfounded but a segment of our population will continue to seek division over unity. Im putting on my Nike shoes!
Because Nike proudly stands for Hope all will stand for decency.
People who are really down for this & burning their ALREADY PURCHASED items are whack The man has spent his whole life honing his craft blood/sweat tears & by shining a light on injustice he gets black balled & can no longer do what he loves.
Causally related or not (?), Nike shares are down a bit in premarket trades after Kaepernick news. | $NKE
I will boycott Nike. All of you people calling us a nazi are so sad.
Just asking is a first world problem?
White people in rage are hilarious with all these black dollars they about to get y'all won't b missed
I wonder how many people supporting the still support the Catholic Church?
Just think about this... The left is defending a massive corporation that pays the people (mostly kids) in Vietnam who make their product on average $75 a month... Yet they claim to care about income equality and living wage. LOL
No for me because I haven't owned a pair in 30 years. They just don't hold up when real work is involved.
"And I wanna thank my haters too because they be buying my stuff so they can burn it and talk crap about it, hahahahahahhahahahaha.... BUT IT BENEFITS ME!!!!!
Love how stifle more conservative voices by only showing liberal trolls on thread aimed at boycotting a liberal narrative by Nike makes me sick it's not cause of the libtard trolls but that's all you see on thread
Massive school shootings on a regular basis, Trump supports stay silent while hugging their guns. NFL takes a stand against police brutality and you'd think someone sucker punched their grandmother. And yet another act of stupidity we have . Jesus...
Good point. Local shelters, humanitarian groups will take new or gently used footwear. Old pairs are worthless though.
I just made twitter and the first thing I see is ? Are people really going to boycott because they are supporting somebody who stood for something bigger than himself?Dont buy Nike shoes. You dont deserve to look cool anyways lol.
are yall serious. Hoing to buy a pair TO-DAY!
But your President friends with Putin! U dont care bout that though RT : Always a smart business decision to sign a spokesman who wears socks calling cops pigs and a Castro t-shirt....
's who boycott products, usually can't afford the product anyway. Just a hollow gesture to cover up their own feelings of inadequacy.
Really BAD move ! I have spent thousands of dollars on your products over decades. However you will NOT get one more red penny of my money ever again!
Here is a real cause to boycott something over.
Honestly if you're gonna boycott Nike products, do it because of their use of sweatshops to make their products and not because they signed a football player who's spreading awareness about injustice.
Before you so-called patriots burn your Nike gear, check with your local Veterans Hospital to see if there is a Vet that can use them. I see a lot of homeless vets in the community that could use a pair of shoes.
Another trend where people show how stupid/ignorant they areI mean it's only those whiny rich kids who never worked a day in their life or "behind the times" older generation taking part so I'm expecting someone to burn their house down soon
Seriously Nike.... SHAME ON YOU!
I don't care who anyone donates to or supports personally. But when a company makes a political issue the face of their marketing campaign, they are making the use of their product a political statement, essentially forcing a
"You know, when I'm running 100 yards and back in full padding, I need all the oxygen I can get. That's why I support breathing clean air". That absolutely was Colin Kaepernick speaking for the National Oxygen Institute, no joke. Racist turds, you know what to do
To all those who want to get rid of dem Nike's bought here's my email.sibusiso.magagula4.com don't worry theyl go to the needy
Now I feel better about the last pair I bought my daughter for cross country (because say whatever else you want, they are well made shoes!) even if it just irks Trumpsters ;D
the is the dumbest thing ever, though this is our country now, filled stupid people.
How to use
really hope Nike stands strong with Colin. The fuckery to think this is about the flag & country! It is real simple: it is about the injustice minorities face in said country. Donate your Nikes to deserving people instead of burning them.
Its just like white supremacists to participate in a by burning their stuff rather than donating it....your racism is still showing.
I do give you credit, you saw the end coming (due to your poor play) and latched onto a make believe cause....
trump supporters conservatives get over about
Wtg ! You just pissed off half of your customer base by making Kaepernick your representative. ... Sell your Nike stock before it's too late.
Business wise, not a smart move . being it's just a few months before Christmas.
I had no idea how many Police Brutality Supporters there were in America. Sad!
your favorite 2 support kaepernick - and
People(racists) are saying that since Kaepernick was adopted by a white family or makes millions of dollars, that he's a hypocrite. I'm sorry, I didn't realize you don't understand how 'empathy' works or how someone can push for the betterment of others
Destroying your Nike clothing and shoes because athletes kneel against racism and police brutality is not only stupid, it's pathetic. NIKE already got your money. That piece of fabric, hanging on a pole is NOT more important than people and equal treatment.
A multi national commercial clothing company endorsing social justice all the while selling you product made in child sweatshops for next to nothing oh the irony just shows how dumb liberals are 2+2 cannot equal 5
Supporting a because of an ad backing 's stand against police brutality means you are more upset about someone kneeling during an anthem than you are about innocent young men - sons, brothers, and fathers, being murdered by police. Let that sink in.
Kudos to the many many tweeps saying donate your stuff to homeless vets and at least try to show some REAL patriotic support to those who gave us so much instead of just being pyromaniac tribal twatwaffles.
How to use
SMH, and come together for their new "Death To America" ad campaign
America: "But he disrespected our country and the veterans who fought and died for a land that my ancestors took by rape, murder, captivity, disease. Also kneeling against racial discrimination, injustice, and police brutality against minorities "Colin:
this don't mean shit because those bots are still there in full force.
Hey, Here's your newest spokesman. If you're going to burn down your own house, you might as well do it with the endorsement of a terrorist!You , alienating 1/2 your base, like bankrupt .
so now theres a because they were helping support a man who did nothing but take a knee during a national anthem that im sure they sit on their couches and watch from home? lmao ok sounds about white.
Wal-Mart, Disney, Sears used Bangladesh factory in fire via people died in in 2012 because of poor working conditions thanks to and other large companies!
So all the white people supporting this please donate all your Nike products to the nearest shelter oh yes the Jordans and the Adidas comes to
FUCK that Ima continue to wear their shoes and support their brand
Boycott! Boycott! Boycott! Boycott! Every week we are deciding who to hate and which company to boycott. We have become the laughing stock of the major nations. It's time this whole nation grows up. Just boycott my post if you don't like it.
NKE 82.20. Let's see how well your pathetic decisions on placing Kaepernick on your new Just Do It ad works out.
?? Damnit I just bought myself some white sneakers Im gonna wear the fuck outta them cause all my other shoes got holes in them
Its seriously a joke to these ppl of why CK is doing what he is doing so he got backed up by a company and you guys are mad lmfaooo yall a joke to this country for every one paj2r you destroy its 10 being bought by ppl who side with him the ones who SEE his pov
I won't/can't throw away or burn my because they were too expensive, BUT, I won't be buying them ever again. I don't boycott for just a little while, I boycott forever. I still won't spend my $'s at So STUPID Nike to hire
A boycott means not buying something, not destroying your property or purchasing more from the target to virue signal for those precious clicks.Fools and their money...
I wear a size 9 in women shoes and 7 in kids, 8 in Mens.... since yall mad just pass em on
Racist claim to love this country and the military so much that they are willing to burn Nike Gear for supporting Kap. Why not donate that "gear" to the homeless vets who could use a "new" pair of shoes, shirts, socks, etc.,?
These racist wasn't thinking nothing about until this ad... any black person asserts them selves or stand for they believe in they try any & everything to stop them. Can't hang us anymore... You mad
I'm not gonna because I've got ten pair that I live in but I'm gonna think about wearing another brand.
This is weird If you can't afford it just say it
Going out this morning to buy the WHOLE family brand new even the toddler, who up to this point, Ive refused to spend that much $ on his shoes. He grows out of them way too fast! Ill make an exception.
This is a joke lol. But hey; by participating in this and burning all your Nike stuff, youre really just participating in the message of the actual ad. So bravo!
All of y'all are just angry white people. Thay's the only reason this is a thing.
These MAGA people are showing how privileged they are cause Nike products are not cheap but they can still afford to burn them. Couldnt be me
I never would have spent a dime with Nike in the past had I known they support violence against law enforcement and cop killers.
will result in minority American rednecks buying alternative fake goods or shopping at Target & Walmart as per their demographic.Meanwhile, global Nike sales will skyrocket because the world hates everything Trump's Little America stands for.Bravo, Nike. Bravo
People complaining about others showing their dislike for Nike by destroying Nike products are the same people who burn flags to show their disapprovement. Irony at it's finest
The most hilarious part about these people burning their Nike shoes is the fact that they owned athletic apparel to begin with.
Nike already has your money so destroying the products you bought from them to feel cool isn't doing shit. If any of you had a soul you would at the very least DONATE all those shoes and clothes to the homeless. Now THAT would make a statement people could support.
If youre mad at your shoes today dont burn them. Donate them. School just started and a lot of kids could use shoes.
I had never been much of a fan of , but I have spent a lot of money in the past on gear. They are owned by Nike so I won't be buying them anymore. I don't want to support race baiting and division.
Whoever cooked up that ad is a genius. Everyone is talking about it, many people who dont own Nikes suddenly want them, and dumb people are basically burning their money in the street. Its like a battle of wits with an unarmed man.
would be such a noble cause had it been because of Nike's slave labor making that gear you are burning.
"P TAPE" is being reported by sources with knowledge of the accusation, AS A PEDEOPHILE TAPE.TRUMP IS AND HAS BEEN A PEDEOPHILE.
I will participate in the because the NFL squatters have encouraged police murder This isnt two points of view, its leftist destruction vs all thats good. We will win.
This was a genius business move by Nike. The internet spotlights the shit heads of America. Fuck
Or just go donate.
just burned my nike seats, headphones and shoes, "Just Don't Do it" hello my new sports apparel
they already had the black business, what they did was just alienated half the country by promoting a selfish whiny racist cop hating social justice warrior, who by the way until he met that chick who leads him around by his nut sack he didn't think that way.
If anyone is thinking of burning their size 11 Nikes, just let me know and Ill take them off of your hands.
He use his teeth to cut these?
I been boycotting Nike for years even before this, they are responsible for the forced child labor they used to make their products.
NO Medium has words sufficientre the Might of Nature/FatebutANDLOVE always trumps Hate.Praying for Gulf CoastALL in Gordon's pathre ..-as-Begging:On a Beachin a Gardenat a Game..Just BE.You'll SeeWE!√°ir√≠nsTip‚Ñ¢
Just a friendly reminder for all those people... this is what happens when you call the Cops.Warning, graphic content!
Hey , your individual statements and defacing of nike apparel wont make an impact. Lets make a large noticeable demonstration! Send me all your nike stuff and Ill turn it into something those Nike bastards cant ignore!Send to 7 closedminded rd. 43085Just do it.
Later, will tell us that the "something" to believe in, is Socialism.
This will cause to go into Chapter 11, congrats!
If youre planning on participating in the by destroying or throwing away your Nike gear, please consider donating those items to a great cause like the instead.
I just want to know what respecting the flag looks like to supporters. Im seeing a lot of conflicting messages on this point
When will the adults in these companies, , , and take back control from the Social Justice Warriors running them into the ground?
people, instead of burning and destroying your Nike stuff, why not donate it instead? There are people and kids out there less fortunate than us who need stuff like that. I'm sure they'll appreciate it and get better use out of it.
wrote: "I'm not taking sides; I dont understand..."Because MOST people do takes sides in such matters; there is no silver lining to racism, discrimination, & hate. will be just fine. Too bad the didn't have the same courage.
You know what would really own the libs? If you took the money you're symbolically saving on a and give it to a or community in need. has given over $4.5 million to local communities alone.
I just trashed my Nike products and won't be back. I guess they're going to base their business on the black community. Go for it.
Im here to say that on the behalf of Black people everywhere we will not Boycott Nike because of yall racist and illegitimate president
Trump supporters will boycott Nike for signing Kap and Nike sales are still gunna skyrocket
Nike uses 3rd world child slaves most who are african to make their sneakers. Boycott them over Colin is just stupid. Besides porky pig did it better.
anybody knows some good Russian shoes brands?
Taking advantage of the to beg into the ether: NIKE CAN WE PLEASE GET SOME EXTRA WIDE HIGH TOPS IN HERE THANK YOUUUU. -Sincerely, a wide foot guy tryna support the swoosh but cant.
Ok so people are cutting there socks and burning there shoes because of a Nike ad? They already got your money they couldn't care what you do with your stuff.
I understand a in regards to not buying any future products. But why burn an already owned product? You just lose the shoe, they still keep the money....
Im not part of but my last 6 pairs of shoes have been Brooks because of the comfort.
Were assuming that Trump supporters own athletic gear. Thats hilarious.
On my way to buy some more Nikes. Haven't for a while but I want to own the Trumpers. (Plus, I actually need some sneaks)
If y'all wanna boycott that's on you. I'm going to keep wearing not because I agree but because i enjoy their products. When are we going to stop boycotting once we don't agree?
If youre burning your Nikes to support veterans instead of GIVING them to homeless veterans whose health care Trump degraded, then maybe its time to question what youre REALLY so upset about.
PSA: to anybody who is calling themselves boycotting , you can kindly slide those size 5.5 or 6s this way.just saying . sincerely,a proud supporter .
I stopped buying Nike years ago. This isnt the first time Nike have tried to make a statement. They know by using certain people it will provoke others. Too much BS fro me.
What's even more disgusting than the / ad is all these people on twitter asking people to send them their used shoes.
Nike's a smart Company that I hope this comes back to eat at your profits.. Because you backed a loser and cry baby that should work at 7-11..
what you people are arguing is UNJUSTIFIABLE. so just stop it. period.
Someone would have said white supremacy or too white because is the whitest player alive Even though Watt helped people of all color it doesnt fit the narrative of stirring the pot
Im wearing all today because its comfy and I dont give a shit.
that must be it ! Glad you have a handle on it all.... Unbelievable how blatantly stupid thoughts just spew out of some people's mouths.
Mom I burned your Nike shoes because Im making a statement
If you're not taking a knee, you either don't know why people do it or you don't care that we're mowing down unarmed black men at a ridiculous rate. $NKE
i support Colin Kaepernick, whether you like him or not he has given much for his beliefs, and i applaud NiKe, for all to burn,boycott go ahead,many others will buy, i know i will.
If i havent bought any items in 10 years, does that mean I am part of this ? Since makes better shoes, makes better clothes and any brand makes better golf items. it obvious i think Nike sucks
Im sure Nike is shaking in their high top Jordans after the way they saw these same boycotters destroy Starbucks for promising to give refugees jobs and Target for letting people urinate where they want.
Id say no ..... just really disappointed that its coming to this . Imma vet Yes i think theres an issue with (SOME) LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT ALL ARE BAD!!! Now im extremely EXTREMELY disappointed that they the players aren't doing a dang thing on there down time !WOW!
Sadly, all of the kids working in Nikes Vietnam sweatshop cant afford to do the same. Maybe Ill donate my daughters old pair to them.
Its amazing how the left seems to care about children & their felon parents illegally crossing an international border but don't care about those working in Nike sweatshops. They will now rush out to waste their money on a company that exploits children for profit.
I find it funny that people are burning shoes they already purchased. Nike already made their money. You're just wasting yours.
If you're not taking a knee, you either don't know why people do it or you don't care that we're mowing down unarmed black men at a ridiculous rate. $NKE
I wear a size 12 or 13 if any of you people would like to donate your shoes to a good cause. I have had part of one foot amputated and I'm sure that sneakers would make life easier.
These are the same dumbasses that have already bought Nikes for years not only for themselves, but also their children and grandchildren. What these idiots don't realize that Nikes are sold around the world and the rest of the world don't give a fuck about this.
(Part 2) Can't stand businesses ruining the brands we liked & Celebrities in Hollywood disgusting us so much that we can't watch anything they're in. 2/2
How is this going to work when literally everything is Nike. College's, the entire NFL, and not to mention outside of the US.... Real football
Couple of things about . Nike already has your money.2. Nike is a global company. The 'racist Trump supporter' demographic is pretty small to them.3. You'll all have forgotten this by next month.4. You snowflakes sure are easily offended by everything.
I think will be just fine.
While I don't support or agree with your new advertising campaign, I do admire you for willing to support and "believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything"
Colin K. Is a man in blue hater, anti-American, racist, does not respect the American FLAG and the National Anthem and much more! Nike, you just lost many AMERICANS trust and business.
Ok I don't know what's going on but I'm wearing Nikes today, am I supposed to cut these up for something? I'll ask the boss if I can just walk around in socks all day.
seriously, dont be an asshole. Donate
Stand for the national anthem, Just do It (TM)These jokes write themselves.
Clearing out my IRA for sure, close of biz today order. Can't support haters.
Nike is focused on regaining ground with younger customers in major cities (including international cities), so this seems like a smart business move
Melania Trump to launch a new brand name 'KKK- Just burn it!'
Just like their earlier this year, literally throwing their own money out the window
Colin Kaepernick, , spit on the graves of US servicemen, including the 25 black recipients, 1/2 of whom earned it for SAVING the flag he disrespects with .
Its sad how white people can come together for this but when its time for black people yo stand together or boycott we dont and still go buy the Gucci, Versace etc... smh
Not in this house. love my nikes!!
Thats Awesome! You just did it! knew what it was doing & the consequences of choosing Nike is truly doing & stating with there actions is that Nike is BOYCOTTING DEPLORABLE MAGAS
When does idiocy become a serious concern with this nonsense.
Then again I guess it doesn't really matter. I just realized I quit buying Nikes overpriced sweatshop clothing years ago.
purpose for destroying Nike products is simple:MARKET VISIBILITY. Destroy the product, destroy the brand. Goodbye SWOOSHNo more Nike purchases.Just dont.
Are you kidding me? I hope your sales and your stocks drop to an all time low just like your anniversary advertisement.
Nike should start making white robes with pointed hoods and get all their customers back
All across America this morning, racists are sleepily reaching through a sock drawer and pulling out swooshes and theyre getting *so mad* and some of the dumber ones are probably punching walls and whatnot and its positively glorious
Buying new Nike's today!! If I could afford it I would buy a whole new work out outfit!! I support you Nike!!
Missed opportunity: selling lighter fluid to morons. I need to fire my Chief Idea Officer.
All these people saying they are boycotting Nike are the same people that said that they are boycotting Starbucks for not putting baby Jesus on the cup ..... and they are all back at Starbucks
all because some dude took a knee? America get a hold of yourselves honestly ps any size 7 Airmax marked for the fire pit... im willingl, begrudgingly, to take them off your dumb fucking hands.
This is a tough one for me because I think is a good football player, cops can be trigger-happy authoritarian bigots, and America exists to encourage criticism of itself.But is just outlet mall, sweatshop garbage.
America. You never fail to deliver. Lol! for allowing traitorous bastards to kneel during the anthem!
This country is full of wussies & butt hurt people. If all brand shoes honored Kaepernick they would stop buying shoes period even when you know you need more pairs? Ha!
As someone who loves ads, and ad busters, and the whole debate around ads, and the NFL kneelers, this makes me very happy.
Folks really out here cutting up Nike socks and recording themselves so it? I can't take you idiots seriously and neither does Nike!
JUST IN: shares down 1.1 percent pre-market
Listen if any of you want to keep destroying your Nike products just send them to somebody or give them to the homeless. Other than that we don't care.When was the last time any of your other boycotts ever worked ? ? ?
I will not buy anything bcuz they disrespect our first responders, our military, our flag , our nation by sponsoring the treasonous anti American
Motherfuckers are not boycotting Nike. It's just their excuse cause ain't got money to buy a pair. Tomorrow their boycotting Bentlys and Lamborghinis
Gonna go buy some just cuz
Since its obvious how stupid you imbeciles are, make sure you take off your Nike's before your burn them , you ignorant, racist , imbecile.
Converse is owned by Nike- you dont want to give them your business either!
Just do it
I will never buy another Nike item. There are People who dont agree with this boycott that buys your items as well. It will not be me supporting you.
And cause ya know cause he's white
Couldn't select a better role model for their new campaign! selects Colin Kaepernick for ‚ÄòJust Do It ad campaign
Nike wont lose anything from this marketing campaign but a handful of racist customers. Good for them to stand up to the bigotry of Trump and the NFL
Your intelligence is showing trump supporters. What exactly do you think will happen to Nike after you destroyed something you already paid for? If you want to boycott something boycott the school system because it's clearly failed you.
I don't own a pair, have always preferred Adidas.But as a former member of the Armed Services, methinks Nike Just Blew It...
Yall will never boycott that ignorance though, nor our music yall struggle to twerk to
Your daily guide on burnishing credentialsAbuse the soldiers who fought to keep country safe Celebrate sacrifice of multi-millionaire players
The craziest thing about a is that Nike has been conducting unethical practices like using child sweatshops to create their products and people were ok with that. They stand with Cap and that was your final straw? Oh yeah, youre racist.
Obviously you haven't sacrificed everything, now you are making millions on this Nike ad and the cause you say you believe in. Why stop there? Open a GoFundMe page and make even more money off these people you have fooled with a lie.
will be losing them customers now. There is a lot of going around due to . oh dear.
You've done nothing but kneel, and, NOW, getting paid for it.The people on both sides lost in police-community relations nightmare are heroes.WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, REALLY?Profiting on death. NICE.Or should I day NIKE. . (dolt)
Ive bought your products my entire life. Now, I buy(bought) them for my kids! I cannot support you any longer! I will not support a company that has turned its back on my great nation! You are a disgrace
If you don't want 'em... I'm a 10 and a half. Just saying.
New Balance are made in USA anyway! Much better than Nike. Support America and show how it feels to float a company on liberal money only - wait for it! is
I just don't care. I will wear whatever shoes I want. I dont care about Kaep either or his cause.
Anyone who is able to stand for the national anthem and DOESNT...Should not be able to make money and get applause! Ill NEVER buy Nikes again
Idek why people are supporting the Since when do white trash people wear Nike in the first place??? And, if anything, doesn't the boycott only help promote Nike's brand by displaying how they stand up to injustice? So basically the logic behind the boycott is invalid
It's intriguing. Those who are tweeting pro Nike seem to be mostly African American. (Profile pics) I'd have to say racism is showing its ugly head.Just an observation.
just Reeboked themselves
Pence to gulf coast so no papertowel thrown. NO Smart ppl know peacefully brings attention to police brutality against African Americans, racism & inequalities &nothing 2do w/disrespecting flag, anthem or USA
Just this weekend I went to a store at the outlet mall to shop for some winter running clothes and shoes for my morning walk/runs with Strider.Thank God I didnt buy anything!
waking up to this yall need to stop. Get some business.
American flag has nothing to do with police brutality and Kapernick should have never intertwined the two. Nike is just ignorant to use him among so much controversy and division. Such a bad business move!
Kaepernick is nothing to rally around and if I have to just to save what's left of the NFL and keep leftist politics out of sports I will.
Republicans will get round to their just after they have finished boycotting Nordstrom's.
is just another illustration on how this nation will ALWAYS remain divided. Fake patriotism.
Bruh. Just not my reason.
Absolutee image rehabbing genius on Nikes part. Anyone actually believe they sincerely care about the cause?
GoodOnYou rates Nike as Not Good Enough when it comes to labor, environment and animal welfare. They advise you to Just (Dont) Do It
Disgusted.
If your social justice warrior wears shirts promoting a dictator that jailed and tortured POC, then
Im boycotting anyone who supports a
What do , Sean Hannity, and Rush Limbaugh have in common? There all a fucking stupid idea and people.
Brands really need to steer clear of politics. Why build the divide?
THE RUSSIAN BOTS ARE BACK
Nike just said fuck your racist money.
He isnt using a voice He just kneels at his job. So courageous
You the muthafuckah this ad campaign is for!! Because you wouldn't do half of what has done. Did he know he would have to risk it all NO,but did that stop HIM NO!! my ass
What is this country coming to?All of this to deflect from the real issues. Shame on us!
Brilliant marketing move by Nike. The has garnered more buzz than they've had in years aside from the sweatshop thing, which is worth a boycott but that's just my opinion
made an awesome strategic move! Those who have a heart for humanity will continue to support, those who dont will abandon the brand, but Nike is fine either way!
With all the racist participating in the I might be able to finally cop some exclusives on the SNKRS app
I just ordered Ts for my whole family.
your Nike Sneakers.....put these on and just walk away to moronville.
Nike doesn't realize that most of their customers are white. How dumb are they?
Nike did this because they know white people dont wear Nikes they wear Asics
Ive always loved I feel so grateful that they are standing up for social justice in such a powerful & provocative way!My first thought this morning before even seeing was trending was:Wow I am going to buy Nike FOREVER! (I kid you not)
From a US symbolic mark to an anti-US brand, it happened to in the blink of an eye!:))) Whats wrong with you ?
Nike is the Greek goddess of victory. So, go ahead racists and to your hearts content. Truth and justice will winout in the end.
Let me just go clearly on record now... > ( )
Since these White People wanna cause of Colin, let all of us Black Folks boycott the entire NFL for black balling him
"For anyone to try put words in their mouths or assign to them motives that they've clearly denied, or to try and shame and silence them because this all makes them uncomfortableis the very definition of privilege."
This hashtag is the reason why whites and blacks will NEVER get along. At this point us black people need to be fighting for the upperhand instead of the equal hand. White people will always believe in police brutality and Trump.
If you will boycott a company that sells inanimate objects, but support killer police that kill humans, you might be a...
I see trending with several thousand tweets. I feel like the majority of people saying theyre boycotting are people who werent gonna buy Nike anyway.
The irony is that the is just another fabulous example of white privilege. Youre destroying name brand sports wear. Expensive shit. That you, yourself, bought. WAKE. UP.
Nike wont go broke because SOME ppl decide to boycott.
Also to the ignorant people who are planing to I would like to point out that you are trying to boycott a SHOE COMPANY for supporting a FOOTBALL PLAYER who stood up to racial inequalityYou are literally throwing a fit over people wanting to be treated like humans
Instead of donating their Nike shoes/clothes, people are burning it or throwing it away. There are thousands of Homeless Veterans out there that would wear them. Save your fake outrage, snowflakes
You may want to call the Dixie Chicks, just sayin
JUST SUCK IT!!!! You are losing a 40 year old fan whos spent thousands on your sneakers! Maybe not much to you but Nike has always been a staple in my house! No more!
All these swagerless bitches now "boycotting nike" acting like they don't just buy whatever shoe is on the bargain rack
Just like the voting booth I can also vote w/my wallet. Kaepernick & Nike can both go to hell! I WILL NOT purchase Nike products nor watch/go to an NFL game & ask my family/friends to do the same. Stand for our flag, our country, or leave. GOD BLESS America!
Liberals can boycott any company that helps donate to the NRA and still cry when they realize Nike is about to tank because of the incoming
Burning kicks now buying kicks soon, 1 year is a long time time for the issue to die down. would love if everybody burns em, just to cop again later. my ass. I see crazy people.
People are making a big waste of their times to burn something useful to wear and to pass it down to their kids or friends.
I rather kneel, then to spit in someones face. Just do it, and place your order at ..com . . . . . . . . . .
Im just tweeting to keep it trending on Twitter
Its a sin to kill a mockingbird.Atticus Finch
Ive been wearing for years . They JUST DO IT for me personally. I guess Nike is counting on all patriots watching these kneelers disrespecting our flag to get behind them? Nike is stirring the pot and they underestimate millions of Americans . Bye Nike !
Nike is an international brand. They sell products at every corner of the globe. This US bull clearly rooted in racism wont make a dent
Do companies like Nike really think that adopting an anti-white business model is going to be profitable? Do they really think the demographic theyre targeting can replace the demographic theyre alienating?
Aye, if yall got any air maxes in a size 12.5 you wunna boycott just DM the kid
LMAO at all the MAGAts who are trying to start a , good luck w/ that! Trump & all his stooges will be gone/forgotten very soon and Nike will be just fine!RETWEET: NIKE CHALLENGE!
We can train our children to hurl smaller chunks of this great country at oncoming missiles! David in the Bible used a sling. He beat Goliath. Coincidence?
In fact, with such great patriotism, we don't even need muskets. We'll use trebuchets! The rocks we fire will be made in America and of America!
Fuck those missile launching systems! Muskets are what made America great! We'll shoot down things with muskets! No more missiles!
Whitehouse Captivity Day 591: Orange Husband is MORE crazy today. No bathroom time for Tweets. I'm worried that he's going to complete melt down. Maybe I do something to help. OH! I go shopping for new sneakers. Get some sexy Colin K kicks & Tell press is STUPID..
Hey Nike, is trending better than the Nike hashtag. Ever think you just made the wrong career decision?
When I was 7 or 8, I watched a documentary about the sweatshops Nike used to produce their goods and vowed never to buy/wear any Nike clothes. Not to blow my own trumpet, but the kid I was seems to have had a better sense of morality than the people demanding a today
if nike is condoning colin Kaepernick and using this unamerican unpatriotic individual in any of their campaigns... then I and my entire family have just bought our last nike products....
This is America- Boycott if you wish- but if you plan on destroying a good pair of Nikes, why not be kind about it and give them to a homeless person, or someone else in need? Just a thought...
Some of these Nikes I see you whackadoos destroying look like you got them at a yard sale 15 years ago. I assure you Nike will be just fine without you.
Same people participating in the are the same people who defend a known racist, Steve Bannon.. watch your friends closely.
lmfao these trump supporters pretending they have enough money for Nikes is hilarious....get your ass back to Wal-Mart
A ? Seriously, y'all are that mad.
Nike $NKE have just made their next few upcoming quarterly reports so much more interesting with the decision to feature in a campaign. We'll get to see almost directly how the backlash () affects business. 1/4
please all those destroying shoes/clothes just donate them.
gulf coast. NO Feinstein trump picked-wants to protect trump b/c said GOP potus Trump s/d b exempt from civil suits, criminal investigations & criminal prosecutions &Trump is under many investigations
Lets to show that we support police brutality!!
MARKET ALERT!!If you have Nike in your portfolio you need to drop it like a hot potato ASAP first thing this morning, the stock is going bust! Down significantly this morning in premarket futures!
Can we get a pacemaker company to support Kap? That way all these old wypipo will rip out their own?
Nike has been paying little Chinese kids pennies to cobble their Air Max together for years and no worries, brother. That's cool. Now they've got a dude who kneels during the national anthem in their ads and suddenly it's pitchforks and torches time. Okay America.
How far do the Nike boycotts reach? Is it just the brand or everything they sponsor too?
i'd like to thank everyone who is supporting the you all got it trending and now you are promoting the brand! and also to those of you who chopped off your swooshes, thanks for your payment to it really helps us advertise. love you guys so much xoxo
Bro if youre burning Nike Gear because they signed Colin Kapernick, you really need to get your priorities straight. Original point had nothing to do with Supporting or not supporting the military. I truly dont get it. Does anyone remember the original point?
I haven't bought Nike in a long time... this will be simple, Just do what I always have done for years, buy something else.
I totally understand the . People in 2018 have no wish to support a backwards-thinking company like .
The most ignorant comment thus far...
Boycotters: um. So you support police brutality and racial injustice? Now I get it.
I woke up to see a wave of conservatives cutting up their gear because of the brands new advertising campaign.Why do yall hate Pat Tillman, the military, and America?
just do it! Buy from someone that not an idiot
Hey F*cken and racist Colin Kaepernick, a cop just got shot in the head in Georgia trying to protect people. Hey Colin, take your socks depicting cops as pigs and get out of my country.
is a thing now ? Damn people are taking this way too serious
In all due respect, most of the people speak Russian as their first language.
My guess is that this campaign will be heralded as one of year 2018 best campaigns - and any GOP / KKK inspired will only add to its popularity. This campaign TIMING is also smart - just before Nov elections. So it is ALSO smart business (and good morals)
America the stupid....... Seriously ..... People are afraid to speak their truth and own up to the challenge and consequences
Will Nike be making the disgusting Pig Cop socks that Kaepernick likes to wear?
Can the be changed to if youre really going to boycott them because a Nike athlete spoke out about police brutality and racism?
My feet have always been because they just don't fit.
Good morning to everyone, except those at . We won't forget that you chose cop-hater Colin Kaepernick to represent your brand. I strongly support our police, not you.
5 time draft dodger is y'all leader. Couldn't make these fools up if we tried. Yall just need a reason to be hateful
As a matter of fact, don't destroy it. Donate it to goodwill, or the Salvation Army. There are people who could use it and give half a shit about ad campaigns.
is a louse.
If you're just going to toss away your Nike stuff why not toss it my way
trending this morning. Americans got their pitchforks out in a jiffy. Not gonna end well for Nike's domestic sales, brand image or the stock price $NKE. The CEO must be realizing the magnitude of this dumb decision by now
I bet the will not turn out the same as the boycott...
People burning Nikes are going to feel just as dumb as the people who smashed all their Beatles albums in the sixties.
Anyone participating in a is proving exactly why was kneeling in the first place: because too many white people value their songs and flags and privilege, above the lives of people of color. support
A cop was just shot in the head trying to protect people yet horrifying associates with communist/racist Colin Kaepernick who wore socks with cops depicted as pigs on them. I could not be more repulsed.
If you participate in a you are ignorant, unAmerican, and a racist. Plus, stupid AF for being any of those things, much less all.
I don't even own a pair... Let me just sip my lean
- you idiots Just exposing yourself for the dim witted trump suckers you are. This was never about the troops,anthem or flag, but keep listening to the Orange nutsac
The thing makes sense about destroying and burning your Nike stuff after you bought it. Here is an idea, why not donate that stuff to people who need it instead of destroying or burning it? You're not going to use it so might as well give it to those who do.
I'd like to see a builder construct a house for Kap and watch people burn their houses
Hey if yall calling for a bc yall pressed why not just go ahead and have a or ?? Just throwin it out there
So you'll telling me that i should cut or destroy my Nike that i just bought recently?in Togo ah and so expensive! Who cares
So let me guess, the bots are pushing the hashtag.. I am going shopping today at to buy gear in my car with the window sticker. All while drinking my Keurig coffee.
It may be considered brand suicide but it quickly became a major topic of discussion on social media. Don't like who represents the product, then don't buy it. Tomorrow it will be something else..
BYE-BYE- no more SHOES, SOCKS- CLOTHING - BYE BYE STOCK!! Cowards for not standing up for OUR COUNTRY! I hear Venazula are looking for sports brand...
I have trouble believing people participating in the are gonna make any impact. Its an international company, and its just a monitory of North Americans who dont support
is as follows.-Low overseas wages complaints, sweatshops, child labor, etc.-Keapernick hates the American Flag, Y'all a bunch of commies!One of these two are legitimate and rational, the other just tells me if I should block you.
Guess what? I am black, I kneel, I will buy more Nike along with my black and latina community! I am against injustice and police brutality. I want equality for my people. 7 year old Aiyana Jones and many others are dead because of stupid cops
If your boycotting Nike. Your absolutely delusional
Funny how the tRUMPERS that want to boycott are the same ones that support their president who doesnt even know the placement of the colors in Our American flag! Fake ass outrage & patriotism!
Nike has made the wearing of their product into a political statment. So no, I won't wear or purchase an item that encourages actions to which I am strongly opposed. SeparationBusinessPolitics
I dont usually buy Nike for my kids. But I am completely on the side of Kaepernick & the players, so my son will be getting Nikes for his birthday next week (Hell love them). Thanks for stepping up Nike!
So I heard Nike signed a contract with colon kapernick. First why. He is an idiot. Man out here preaching about bullshit. But whatever. It aint my business
So folks are mad at Nike for supporting someone who spoke out about issues in America, but they arent mad at someone who disrespected a POW and Gold Star family....
So how many of yall where buying B4 you found out about and are now saying Nike abuses workers? Sit yo $2 ass down somewhere B4 we make change!
While believing in etc., I also believe in Business! Nike- what were you thinking (tho nothing much will stop me buying your stuff )
I wonder if gets a bulk discount for his Clinton Foundation interns? Just sayin'...
I love the people supporting now, instead of burning merchandise when it was reported that they were using child labor. Nike taking the moral high ground won't make me buy their shit, but apparently some guy standing up for what he believes is worse than child labor.
For the rest of us, who are sane, theres a fantastic Nike Outlet store in Centralia Western WA. is stupid.
Half? Really? I think youre being overly generous about how many of these folks actually bought Nike products to begin with
Donald Trump vilified John McCain and all P.O.Ws , Heroes dont get captured  this doesnt bother the same people calling
Kaepernick had every opportunity in life thanks to his white parents he lived the yet now claims our law enforcement is a group of racist murderers.
't be stupid and hurt your own property.... Just don't buy nike again if you do not like their virtue signaling.... easy... No one likes their brands taking sides.
The people joining the are the same people who support a "president" who makes a mockery of the law & law enforcement every day & insulted & defamed a veteran who devoted his entire life this country, yet they claim respect for police and vets as their reason
Please do not burn your Nike shoes or a apparel while intoxicated. Do not do it in a forest. Do not burn them in your living room. Do not burn them while wearing them. Do not throw them at your friends after lighting on fire. Science says these action R dangerous.
As far as the issue , I'm indifferent. I don't buy Nike products anyway because they are overpriced and frankly, not better than less expensive products.
Plenty of charities that can use what you're discarding..then again this boycott only seems to be in the USA..nevermind
as a sneakerhead, I haven't bought a pair of Nike's in over 3 yrs, not because I think Nike is the most hypocritical company on the planet but because their product sucks. Nike is stuck in the past. Wore out the retro game. Products look like shit brand new
because of Gaza not ...
just lost at least half their customer base. Time to buy some
people are really making trend? well, make sure to get rid of your Hurley, Jordan and Converse products as well because they're all owned by Nike.
I love you & I adore you thats why I SPORT YOU thank you for supporting WE cant do it alone since last year bc Collin hasnt been picked up I dont support the but I do support the
Adidas are better trainers than Nike anyway. Best Nike trainers were Nike Division rest are shite
While y'all have fun with the I think I'm going to go off an buy myself 2 new pairs of sneakers for college because it's what I deserve and Nike is my brand.
Wow!! I do not understand how Nike can use Kapernick as a spokesperson. What about one of our brave military heros, police officers, firefighters or any other American who puts their life on the line each day? Not a whinny, self absorbed, selfish former athlete.
Hatred has ALWAYS been abound they just needed donald to bring it out. Vessels of hatred and white supremacy. Take a pic of their faces they'll be running back in their holes soon
The is stupid, it'll flop just like that In-N-Out boycott because people can't restrain themselves. Nike took a calculated risk but it's crazy how many capitalists hate seeing capitalism at work.
The people burning their Nike gear are the same people who carry tiki torches and whine and cry every time a Confederate statue comes down.
Its ... If youre going to participate in the , be the blue blooded Christian American that you are and DONATE your shoes to kids who need them. If you cut them up, youre just a selfish POS crybaby.
dont burn your goddamn shoes/socks/shit people could actually use. donate. mad at a company for whatever dumb ass fuckshit reason? good for you! but those things youre burning could go to those who are less fortunate. donate them to kids/families who need shoes
Heck yeah bruther i just burnt me some of my shoes and posted it on the interwebs maybe mr trump will see it and give me a cookie!
Nike is in every country an is in partnership with thousands of franchises. Plus the shit they destroying is already Bought. , but continue
In light of this ABSURD support for that FLAGFUCKER Colon Kapercuck by -the shoes- I have decided to cut the wings off of all of the Classical Greek statues of the goddess Nike ‚Äì at Athens, Greece
As I watch the dumbest Americans burn Nike shoes because it's ok to be stupid in America. I want the idiots who are scream to know Addidas was going to sign Kap as well. Unfortuniately, they are were too slow
Curious to see how ‚Äòoutraged Trump supporters would deal with these?
Kaepernick, , spit on the graves of US servicemen, including the 25 black recipients, 1/2 of whom earned it for SAVING the flag he disrespects with .
I just might just boycott Sketchers, just to be petty
If yall hate the fact Nike supports Kap why not follow Roseanne Barr to Israel???
People are so quick to boycott anything nowadays. Imagine if the same people would boycott racism and police brutality with the same quickness?
If you're gonna throw all your Nike stuff away because of the I'll gladly take that off your hands dm for postage address and I'll help you do your part
Remember he was benched before he started all this with his radical Muslim girlfriend .His career was in jeopardy anyway what liberal nonsense once again.
Eye just want to take this Time to say Haha
Some people are just seriously fucking stupid.
conservatives are so hateful, they can't even donate the products to vets, who they claim to speak for or support, or to the homeless.... but instead they would rather tear the logo off the products they ALREADY bought as if that was going to make a statement...
lol'ing at because we all know republicans wear New Balance, not Nike
Most of you saying have Nikes that look like this. Probably wont be missing your business anyway
Nike LOST a customer here!! We stand for the flag!!
. . Try to put your ignorance to good use for once.
Do Liberals Really Hate America this much, Unbelievable !Liberals Support Muslims & illegals over The American People !The left have Lost Their Minds ! People, are You Paying Attention ?TDS , is a Serious Mental illness with Liberals !
And be sure and donate as many items as possible. I'd like to see every homeless person, every financially disadvantaged person wearing . I'm sure they would just be happy to have a shirt, regardless of the political message it would send.
I'm not going to pretend to be a caring person. I don't care if you donate your clothes. I honestly want you post videos of you burning stuff and giving your poorly thought out speech trying to justify your lunacy. It's funny to me.
NFL kneeling dilemma solution: Teams/owners sponsor events in the city featuring players speaking about injustices suffered by minorities. Public/media would attend the high visibility event and the spotlight would return to the game happening on the field.
Ok, keep burning your gear you morons. And thank you for revealing yourselfs to the rest of us. Helps everyone know whos who.
The only way has improved the economy has been by having his dummy supporters destroy their shoes, socks, and coffee makers and have to buy new ones.
POLL = NIKE has many Sports Stars signed to promote their Shoes and Gear, but I'll Boycott because they've signed Colin Kaepernick . . .
2018 LOGIC:‚Ä¢ If you buy shoes made by slave child labor youre not racist. ‚Ä¢ If you dont support shoes made by child slave labor you are a racist.
Racist people wanna boycott Nike yall are the problem in this country. For the 1 billionth time, him kneeling has nothing to do with the flag. Its about racial injustice & police brutality. But yall wanna be in denial & in yall own world
so the 3rd world slave and child labor wasn't enough to stop you. but using an activist in their ads was?How is that the line you draw.
Stay Mad: Colin Kaepernicks New Nike Deal Has No-Face-Towel-Twitter Destroying Their Clothes And Its Hilarious
Gonna sit this one out just like the In-N-Out boycott.
Lol people destroying their Nike products. They already got the money for it. You just throwing away your own money that you already spent.
What a RACIST business decision you just made NIKE. Nice work useful idiots!
Headingup to buy two pairs of Nike today JUST DO IT
The Black community are ur biggest supporters... ALSO THE BIGGEST CONSUMERS!!!! Yall not losing with us behind yall. I shall buy another 2 pairs of NIKE! Just to say THANK YOU
Honestly the people who are doing the are just as dumb as those who are boycotting In N Out Burger for donating to the Republican Party. Youre being hypocrites. You dont gotta agree with what is doing but dont do what you called out others for doing
It should be obvious but it bears explicitly stating: celebrities are not necessarily well-informed. Or intelligent. Or honest. Stop caring so much what they say.
Fans Burn Gear in Response to s ‚ÄòJust Do It Ad Campaign | | & panders while slandering countless millions of 's. Not surprising, as plays race card. "Virtue Signaling" to the LCD of ! RT
This is legitimately just people bashing a . It makes me happy. For those select few who are supporting a boycott: your racism is showing. Also: Kaepernick is a hero.
So basically Trump supporters arent buying Nike now?!
If you got any new Nike Tech in a small, kicks in a 6.5w or 4.5 kids that are suddenly causing you emotional turmoil during this horrid time - lemme burn em for you, Ill pay for shipping
Nike, surely you can't be serious...
can someone please explain to me whats with the whole ??? im confusion
Because you're dumb enough to burn 100 dollar shoes.
What if every business followed s lead and the grew to the point that racists had nothing nothing left to consume except Papa Johns and Enerfood.
supporters who started the over are this confused and ignorant. Bet you wont burn them Js tho!
Supporting a racist who progresses a false narrative, with Nike
MAGA SNOWFLAKES- grow up you pussies.
Do you like losing millions? Because this is how you lose millions, good job!
The brilliant advertising now has some downside but at least the burning of shoes will be a boom caused by those replacing their burnt shoes
,, lmaooo the company already has your money ... burning shoes and cutting socks does what exactly ? oh it just ruins the 50 dollar shoes you just bought or the 15 dollar socks you just bought
Yep. Some of us have been boycotting Nike for years anyway because of, you know, child labour and sweat shops.
We are participating in the opposite of the . I just bought a new pair of nikes for each of my kids and myself. Go Kaep go!
If you mad at Nike for signing Kapernick go kill yourself!!! Nike just made America great again!!!!!
I suspect the will be about as effective as the . Record profits prove nobody gives a shit about sky cloth. My only real gripe is that continues to allow its platform to be used as a recruiting tool. Can't fight wars without impressionable children.
I hear there is a anyone know why? Is this just a US thing?
F*CK you white nationalist domestic terrorist bomber shooter s of dumbfuckenstan for Trump. Go to Russia!
I never liked that stupid looking tick anyway. Just bin it.
Do you even know who your customers are ?
just in case, my size is 9 US
To all those people that decided to because the face of the current campaign ad is supposedly "Anti American" before you start destroying clothes & burning shoes to get likes! Donate your products to the less fortunate! That would be the American way!
Just like with the NFL I will never spend another fukin Dime on any of your products again!
Before y'all burn your gear over this , throw it my way, I'll take care of it for you. Especially the shoes. Oh and the shorts and sweats.. those are especially heinous.
It's unsurprising, you're a disgrace to the US and the black community
Nikes next slogan .."Just f$ed ourselves"! Never again will I buy Nike!
is no different than the other side boycotting other products. For me, Kaepernick hasn't used his brain since he began dating Nessa Diab. That is his biggest problem which is no different than many other guys... or even gals.
hey uh I know y'all hate Nike and I'm totally down for helping you purge all those Nike products from your closets. Especially any women's size 7 shoes. Or size small apparel. You know. For the cause.
People are on here talking about burning Nike shit they already paid for or cutting off a god damn swoosh or just a full on and I'm over here not buying Nike because it's too fucking expensive. People are stupid.
Let me get this straight....Nike just chose the extremely racist communist Colin Kaepernick who wore socks depicting cops as pigs and targeted cops to promote its campaign. I will never buy Nike again.
Maybe we can get to shoot their while they're wearing them. They're , they should be used to shooting themselves in the foot:
By the way, all the Patriots who are supporting the ....you do realize school starts for a lot kids this week. If you send your kids into school with some damn adidas samba classics, they are about to be roasted without remorse
So are you encouraging Im curious if I missed it or if you just arent going that far?
if you gonna burn some size 8 nikes just donate to my closet instead
Same way we are laughing at all this fake outrage over police. Yall aint mad blacks kill 8000 blacks, annually, no, you mad cops kill ~120 blacks, annually. What hypocrisy
Why spend money to give sneakers to the poor when you can use that money to sign a 20 million dollar police hating ex-NFL quarterback to a contract to be your spokesperson.
Also please send all of ur unwanted items to my school. I can ensure you they will ALL be put to great use.
Now they gonna act like about slave Labor when theyhad no issue with that before Nike publicly supported kaepernick
I love how there are only a handful of people so furious they are burning their own property...already purchased property triggered
Id like to thank all the daft racist idiots for their futile because youve genuinely made me laugh.
I dont know whats going on, nor do I care. All I know is I just washed 10 of my Nike workout outfits, folded them & put them in my drawer. Shits too expensive to get rid of...or burn.
just spent $500 on Nike store
Nike does so much business overseas with soccer jerseys, the USA is a drop in the bucket

Nike Supports the hijab~~it is not a religious requirement, it is required to oppress women. But found a way to make money! Not in America!
I see the Bot Army was busy last night.
All of you burning Nikes bc you think Kap is disrespecting the flag were okay with Trump using the flag to disrespect McCain You know it's not about the flag or the vets it's all about the color that takes a knee.
So we just destroy our own bought and paid for property to lash out at Nike? This hurts them how? You already own it! Find smarter, more effective ways to make a point.
... This is what Nike is supporting:"I won't stand 'to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses Black people" -Colin Kaepernick, 2016.
BOYCOTT Nike......Just do it!!
I wear Nike trainers. I will continue to wear Nike trainers. The is silly, petulant response to a company showing some support to a legitimate cause.And if you disagree, unfollow me. Please.
: because corporations with Socialist ideals should die.Plus, Asics are better for your feet.
I'm going to do the . Not because of Colin Kaepernick but because of slave labor and also because they are expensive.
Great to see the + ppl destroying their own stuff to...*puts on glasses*...own the libs who havent bought Nike products in years because of international slave labor...
You should strongly consider the millions of veterans & American youth that could benefit from your donation before you go destorying your Nike apparel & shoes. Put your closed-mindedness aside & give back IF you truly care about our country and stop pouting!
Yea, that pretty much sums it up for me. Just like I no longer shop at , I will no longer buy the brand lol
If you are mad at please don't burn your shoes because it is bad for the environment I will sacrifice and take size 12 mens, 4 boys, 1 boys, and 12 in girls. XL in clothes adult, med and small in kids. I can help you make your point.
If you're going to and decide to rid yourself of your Nike's, donate them to your local shelters, Goodwill, Salvation Army, etc. Plenty of people would appreciate a new/gently used pair of Nike's. Sorry that Nike hurt your feelings. :(
If you hillbillies have unused giftcards Ill take them off your hands. Sweatshops and sexism didnt but this announcement does? Does this mean youre giving up college football too?
Americans are fed up with black supremacism, masquerading as "social justice."
Anyone who wants a for hiring Colin Kaepernick is obviously a Trump supporter because let's face it everyone who has criticized him have been Trump supporters
Congratulations to which ever shoe company becomes the new powerhouse!
Any that supports the minority ppl really show there colors
So to any of u participating in this if y'all have any retro's dead stock size 15......if u really wanna get back at Nike just mail them to me.
So will those participating in the also boycotting their universities and colleges too? I find it hard to believe people wont be wearing gear from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, LSU, Missouri, Ole Miss and Tennessee. & thats just a few...in the SEC
Yea, that pretty much sums it up for me. Just like I no longer shop at , I will no longer buy the brand lol
For those who keep using the military as a talking point for - DM me and I can help you find your local military recruiting station.
It's not about America, the anthem, patriotism, or supporting the military. it's about racial injustice and seeking equal treatment under the law. Destroying your Nike apparel only shows that you don't understand what the issues are.
so instead of not just.. not watching a football game or just literally ignoring someone.. kneeling you all are going to destroy things you paid for??
This just confirms that racist white people have bad taste in footwear. I see lots of air monarchs burning no Js or maxes
Wait a second, aren't these people the same folks that let the president disrespect a POW's service in the military?
I stopped wearing sneakers when New Balance moved overseas; I don't support slavery.
Castro murdered thousands of Cubans, admires him. Cops save millions of American lives, Kaepernick calls them pigs. - Lets make this guy our poster child. We say-!!!
If you're going to get rid of your shoes because you don't like the move made by Nike, that's fine. At least consider donating the shoes to those in need of them.
To all the people burning their Nike products yall could just mail them to me ps: dm me for address
When you guys say don't you mean . Don't get it twisted, that's exactly what the scumbag you support means
Too bad a certain political affiliation couldn't make the same heartfelt decision between their country and their traitorous moronic President.
These people like their fires.They used it to burn people accused of being Witches.They used it to drive African Americans out of their neighborhood-even used it to KILL African Americans!They used it to march down Charlottesville.Idiots with fire. Makes sense.
I cannot fathom in any part of my brain people burning product they already bought instead of donating to goodwill at the very least. The same people screaming undoubtedly soon, we need to take care of our own people first
Just destroyed every pair of Nikes's that I own.Now I have no shoes. Heading to the Nike store tomorrow.Take that Libs.
and just like that slogan was changed to "Just blew it!"
LMFAO , you guys are ridiculous.... destroying Nike products to support police brutality and discrimination?... Nike isnt taking a lost at all, yall PAID FOR THOSE PRODUCT which went straight to Nike
I wake up everyday & thank God that I'm not white. It must really suck to hate black for no reason & through temper tantrums when institutions don't oppress black people how you would like them to. White people are actually psychotic
All the people burning their Nike apparel online are doing it for attention and a status symbol. Its socks and old shoes. No Air Jordans.
These idiots destroyed their keurigs... now they're burning Nike sneakers and tearing Nike logos off their clothes... my 2 year old has these same tantrumsjust ignore them, it'll pass or they'll grow out of it.
Do Trump supporters even wear Nike? I thought they were still wearing last years Ivanka's?
is a backup qb at best. is pushing the envelope as they always have.
Hey if your just going to burn your Nike apparel give it to me and I will donate it. Some people need stuff .
're wearing red MAGA hats, I Russia t-shirts, and white pleather walmart sneakers while chanting in unison "Lock her up" and "Build that wall". You can only watch ONE television station.Let me know when the light goes on and I'll stop.
This has me in TEARS. Yall just blatantly showing yall racism
Forget you nike! Im officially a fan of now bc of ur ridiculous stunt putting a person who disrespects our country purposely on an ad. You guys are sick an must not have much patriotism! you prick.
"Just Do It", just fuss enough about no contract and someone, somewhere will give you one just to shut you up.
Im heading to the Nike Outlet this weekend to buy a new pair of sneaks for Zumba. I support companies that support me but Im also frugal.
If You Want A Just Don't Buy Their Products. Destroying Things You Already Paid For Makes No Sense Because They Already Have Your Money & The Only Wallet You Hurt Is Your Own..
Just wait a few weeks and youll be able to buy at 75% off when they go after committing
Thanks folks for revving up sales. Burn your stuff up! Nike cannot be put out of business, neither will it be impacted because of this man alone and a plethora of other athletes it sponsors and those of us who're buying all things Nike FOR LIFE.
I'm probably stating the obvious here but if you burn something you already paid for you are only screwing yourself, snowflakes.
Oh sweet baby jesus this is hilarious.. this one burned his shoes while they were still on his feet
LOL shut the fuck up and JUST DO IT.
EVERYONE joining this is middle aged and White AF lol. Pissed about Nike using for there campaign but support a man who sexually assaults women, lies, cheats and steals and is crooked AF. We'll played guys, burn stuff you already paid for that's smart
At the end of the day, Nike is a business. And while some people can't stopping watching football. They can buy other shoes and products. What an absolutely dumb move by Nike to go political.
America has a serious man-baby problem
uses slave labor in foreign countries.
What ?? I just bought myself a pair of trainers from theyre the best always!
everyone who wants to get rid of their products just bc of politics, at least put your spent money to better use by donating the products to some underprivileged people who would love to have any shoes or clothes at all, let alone a famous fashion brand.
So you got homeless ppl on your street without any shoes on but by all means keep burning those Nikes because football man won't stand up.
Meanwhile no one cares that there isn't clean water in Flint Michigan, devestation from Forrest fires, Puerto Rico Hurricane victims... Ocean life dying like the plague but let's cut up our Nike products because you don't understand racism and equality for all
Okthis is hilarious
you just convinced me to buy Reebok.
interesting logic im gonna burn what i purchased already to show im not gonna buy anything else...atleast donate to charity and be not totally useless
we BN JUS DO N IT W/O SINCE THEY CHOSE ENDORSING historys largest mass dog killing operation we stand w/dogs BALLplayers animal killers not so fn much
Imagine if Nike signed a deal to produce Trump gear and all the racists were confused about cutting up and burning their clothes.
Lets call it what it is. If youre so offended by Colin Kaepernick that you have to burn your own shoes, youre a pussy.
If you're going to participate in , do it because of their unethical labor and environmental practices. Not because they put someone you don't like in their ads.
You MAGAts think mighty highly of yourselves breaking Nike. No doubt they will be just fine without you. Dont you spend the bulk of your money on opioids anyway?
When the means there just might be more 13s out there....
Just the thought of not having to wait in line all night for the new Jordans has some people hoping the is real
Let USA Today and the other clowns in the msm TELL YOU what the biggest news is? No thanks. I think Ill decide for myself what matters. NIKE IS ANTI-AMERICAN! Now thats a big news item!
.. yeah ok, I was just saying I need some dri-fit hoodies!
If phony outrage for sweatshop kids and a fake argument for is causing the loose screw crew to set stuff on fire, just wait until something really bad happens.
Stock Market Who Cares! I just know I'm burning mine they are mine to burn! Oh I forgot that's what white people do oh well can't wash that off. Hey New Voter here too 2020Ûæì¶Ûæì¶ MAGA
Hey MAGAts after you burn your Nike shoes, dont forget to run out to your nearest Nike store to buy some Tiger Woods Nike gear because Trump liked something that Tiger Woods said.
I cant wait until those Kaep pig socks drop, Im be them every color just to piss people off
Just buy
Just when the thought issue died down -2 days before the season starts be like: -
I dont think started his kneeling antics for any other reason than to focus the spotlight on himself due to his failing career...kudos to him because it seemed to have worked!
Wait, where are all these airhead parents going to buy a $100 pair of baby Jordans to hang on the rear view mirror? When that shitty heap could really use that $100 for insurance, tires and gas?
Obvious Magat crowd has no skilll in reading and comprehension, hence trump.How many backwoods bigots wear nike anyways. how many millionaires club jerks wear nikes anyways. I believe Nike will be just fine, if not more so.
Ignorance must be bliss. Will you burn down your home if the builder hires the great .? Trumpflakes just dont think, just like their cult leader.
I want this same energy next Saturday when all yall fans go tailgating & partying for your fav college team (sponsored by Nike)with Nike logos on their jersey
No more for me, sneakers in garbage, threw out husbands Nike shirts and shorts
Hard for you to stay on topic? They may have meds for that. He doesn't believe in anything if you listen to him you will see that. His biggest feat was bringing the NFL to iit's lowest point ever. because they suck too.
Hey people burning their Nike shoes! There are plenty of people and kids that could use those shoes! Instead of burning them, maybe donate them?Youre still getting rid of them either way, so why not help someone else?
Again, jack-offs burning their gear - just like the people who shot their Yeti coolers and smashed their Keurigs: THE COMPANY ALREADY HAS YOUR MONEY!
I, a lib, must admit that I have been ‚Äòowned by the . Burning your own property is the best way to own the libs. Please keep doing it
Funny how that works, isnt it. Hopefully Nike will learn the same lesson; Actions have consequences. either.
this country truly is full of divisve racist idiots. there is no logic in boycotting nike just because they've aligned with . POLICE ARE KILLING UNARMED INDIVIDUALS and OBVIOUSLY that's wrong. america you suck!
Instead of a might I propose a boycott of racists, or of Republicans? I know that it'll be a cold day in hell before any I ever do business with any company who contributes to the party of treasonous .
Just had to hire Cuckpernick.
Same here
There is an entire population that didnt vote for whatever reason, minors unable to vote, but still buy their products. This is going to affect an insignificant amount of people. They should just turn a blind eye like they do the treatment of minorities
suspected white supremacist across America are destroying their Nike brand apparel all because chose to stand against injustice. Not surprised though....
Il y a des marques pour qui le est aussi inefficace que le diss de MGK contre Eminem : Nike, McDonalds, Coca. Encore plus lorsque la raison du boycott est en carton.
All their sneakers are made by cheap labor overseas. They killed the mercantile industry in the US. Trump should place Tarrifs on all sneakers made overseas.
Heres my slogan for . Just DONT BUY IT
BREAKING NEWS: NIKE will be changing their JUST DO IT campaign to JUST BLEW IT!
Just enjoying that is ALL and AAAAAALLLLLL OF THIS BLACK MAGIC ALONG WITH THE IDIOTS BURNING AND TEARING UP CRAP THEY BOUGHT. .
If you want to know why did it and can weather , look at the replies here.Ppl who would use sweatshop slave labor as the outrage of the month suddenly buying products they didnt previously need while poor are hungry and children still in cages.F*ck them
Good to see Nike is in agreement with a murderous regime like Iran.
Knowing nike supports Colin and pissing off a bunch maga white folks makes me happy! Its always been checks over stripes!
Why are people undertaking the I'm genuinely curious as to why people are burning their shit because of an athlete standing up for himself. It's like an episode of The Simpsons.
the only reason you people needed slaves is because your weren't PHYSICALLY capable of doing the work needed to performed. i'm real this morning.
Cant afford different shoes just duct tape over Nike
I don't give a Damn about Nike either....but if you use that racist piece of shit Colin Kaepernick as the spokesperson for your company...You're part of the problem and you deserve what is coming to you.
NIKE is a World Wide Product.You Really think they give a Shit if a handful of Trump supporters don't buy their shoes????
God, why must support the football man?
Here I'll fix it for you . I Riding the Pine to Push a False Narrative.
Yeah! It was about what the flag stood for and Kaepernick is a disrespectful POS! And he will NEVER get a job in the NFL. EVER again And now I am boycotting. cause Kaeperdick is now the face of their merchandise.smh. Stupid is what stupid does.
I just have to laugh at the notion that a few brats are boycotting by tearing up shit they paid for. Real smart. Nike is WORLDWIDE brand..a world that is undoubtedly are standing with Kap. Soooo...?
I'm burning all Nikes! Nike gets children in foreign countries to make those sites for cents! They want to tell us to get behind a terrorist promoting punk like Colin! Just look he now has a Iran terrorist backing him! If Iran thinks he is one of the best players go
I understand if you don't want to buy Nike again because you see through their Fake Woke BS and you don't want to support that...But destroying the shoes you already bought?
to all the player hater .. is a billion dollar industry.. they loose nothing for your hate of . If you dont stand for something ur nothings at all ..
If your leads you to destroying shoes/clothing that a homeless vet, woman, man, or child could use then You. Are. Part. Of. The. Problem. In. This. Country.
So people are destroying their Nike clothes. Cool. Dont do something productive like give them to people in need instead or anything if you dont want it anymore. Just destroy perfectly good clothes someone less fortunate could use.
Uses tagline 'sacrificing everything'Gets paid millions of dollars to appear in an ad campaign.FACT: Closet Communists everywhere hate their own National Anthem/Flag/nationalism of any sort.
I'd like to thank racists for the it makes it easier to spot them now when they have left their Make America White Again () hats in the house.
waiting for The Orange Shitgibbon to weigh in on the , since you know damn well he will use that to try and stir up his Neanderthal base.
I dont usually buy products but I will now. Thanks and I also the new Serena ad.
What are Charlie Kirk, Don Jr, and other bachelors going to use tonight after burning their Nike socks?!?
rotfl. This is hilarious...and it won't work
If youre burning your Nikes to support veterans instead of GIVING them to homeless veterans whose health care Trump degraded, then maybe its time to question what youre REALLY so upset about.
$NKE stocks went down pre-market Dont push it . your stockholders will get mad at you
I know a lot of people are angry at Nike now and to whoever is thinking about throwing away their shoes just send them to me. Ill make sure they get properly disposed in my closet.
Confucius Say~ Conservatives are the biggest snowflakes
hey Im sponsoring a bonfire for all size 12 1/2 and any xl apparel just dm and Ill give you address to send it to because I am outraged
JustDoIt ThankGod I dont own a pair. Yall should try out Adidas
I wonder how many of the people complaining about the Kaepernick / Nike campaign are actually doing something to help our troops? Or the people? Or mending/building Police and Community relations?Seriously though.
Before you go destroying your Nike gear, if you have a pair of Nike Zoom Flys, Pegasus Turbos, or Vaporfly 4% in women's 10.5 or men's 9, please message me I'll take them off your hands. They'll be destroyed in about 2 months.
Lol at the triggered gear destroyers yall look dumb as hell since already had your money I dont know why not just donate to homeless if youre that pressed and stressed GTFOH
Never ever let anyone tell you that having respect for your country makes you a racist.
Stupid supporters truly are the gift that keeps on giving
Post your Nikes if you support &
Chiiiiiile Y'all out there with this Bullshit...Sooooooo here's the thing-Your arrogance and unwillingness to be inclusive is nothing more than your ignorance.
Hey if youre participating in the I just heard that water and breathable air endorsed
Ive bought hundreds of shoes over the years.Now that is the new face of their Just Do It campaignIm gonna buy thousands.No for me! I prefer to . Its not about a flag. Its about police brutality & racial profiling.Just Do It!
Russian bots and sock puppets all in on the .
quit talking to me like, lights on upstairs but nobody's home; Nobody's on shit, just fight me, nobody wants it, unlikely; Get stomped out by redwing shoes,we don't do soft shit ‚Äòround her, fuck Nike;
joins boycotts of Hamilton, Star Wars and you know what - its too long of a listBottom line: Zero businesses were hurt - all had tremendous salesCongrats Nike!!
All in favor of setting up a buy/sell/trade page exclusively for Nike gear? No politics allowed to be discussed, you just sell or purchase stuff??
I dont know why retailers have to join the political mess . people wear your shoes regardless of their political affiliations so why do you have to join all the bullshit ? Cant you just sell shoes?
Can Nike at least make a discount for us people who aint racist and still support them cause I finna buy all their stuff now
players kneel & explain in detail that they love the USA, but can't stand for a song that's racist: pro-slavery & white superiority.Wht ppl insist that players who kneel HATE AMERICA & that's what sticks. White SUPREMACY!
Those same people who are calling for should have call for Donald Trump Boycott the way how Trump downgrade women's and by saying that the Late John McCain is no hero.
With all this I might actually be able to find my size shoes when I need them. We see how well the conservatives boycotts go. These companies are so hurt by you burning their used product that have already been paid for. lol
I just bought my NIKEs
To the people boycotting, no one cares because your mistake is that the you defend the respect and honor while spitting in the face of those who exercise it. Sit down and have a conversation with someone other than yourself.
I mean how much Nike Athletic gear could most Trump supporters have to burn anyway.
before you burn your shit, consider sending it to me instead. You'll feel better not supporting it, and I'll feel better having it!
I don't wear Nike, I have wide feet, so there is that. I do support though and think the ads are amazing! It was never about the flag.
Don't worry we just took a knee from purchasing your items!
Anyone who supports this bullshit is a racist and condones police brutality. Fuck You!
White ppl are real retarded with this shit lol are yall serious what is this proving lol really tho
Always a smart business decision to sign a spokesman who wears socks calling cops pigs and a Castro t-shirt....
as long as is supporting I will not be buying Nike apparel
ordered custom shoes. Thank you Nike!
I, for one, will be buying more products. A man took a stand against injustice. His sponsor stuck with him.
If anything, just secured themselves more black dollars.The black dollar is strong. Dont think so?I can guarantee the same people cutting swooshes off their clothes didnt set foot in a theater to see Girl's Trip or Black Panther. Check those receipts.
Ladies if you gonna and your are a 8.5 or 9 in great condition I'll take them clothes too YOU HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT
People burning Nike trainers out of a perceived sense of moral outrage.... suffer the same dysfunctional warped logic as those who burn effigies and flags over cartoons of a prophet
my sneakers represent hatred towards America, it's flag, it's National Anthem as well as Law enforcementThe Kneelers were asked to give evidence of Police Brutality and Racial inequality almost 8 months agoThey have notMaybe canDisgusting
wow, consider your brand dead to Americans who love and respect our Country and our flag
The American National Anthem is NOT a Racism issue. Anyone who disrespects our country like Kaepernick & Nike do not deserve to be in our country. Keep your Hate & Racist views to yourself, or at least Leave my Sports & Shoes alone.
My will be done when I'm on a jury deciding whether or not a cop used excessive force.
White people are stupid! And most of yall are racist if you going to boycott Nike because of Kaep. You shouldve be boycotting them because they make their shit in sweatshops lmao
I just told a girl I like her shirt because there was a Spider-Man logo design on it, then she called me a pervert. The female logic in this world can never make sense
Oh you had to put politics into your advertising. You KNOW that is a no no. No more for me. Guess Ill Just Do It and go buy some new sneaks. Not wearing yours anymore
Its truly disappointing that people still do not know why takes a knee. Just wait till they have to vote.
I've been on a for a decade because quite frankly the product is dogshit. The irony is not lost on me however that some pompous douche who made a big stink over racial inequality is now the poster boy for a company that exploits minorities in slave labor factories.
With Nike signing Colin Kaepernick to new "Just Do It" campaign and thus disrespecting veterans of the armed forces (because he won't stand for the national anthem), I'll also join the NIKE BOYCOTT.
How many kids are going to be pissed off this morning because their dad burned all their school clothes and shoes last night ??
20 years from now (if we're still a functioning society) we're going to look back on this decade as the most divisive decade since the 60s. We seem to get outraged for the wrong things but when real shit happens no one cares.
Dear stupid people using this hashtag is not going to go and stop Nike from existing just because you're pissed off that Colin Kaepernick and other people out there in the world that have different opinions about the country than you. Give up you babies.
People want to become a thing all because of Colin Kaepernick.. no one gives Addidas this flack being that their founder (Adolf Dassler) was a Nazi ... and this ..
I've never bought before. I'm seriously thinking about starting. is good advertising for a good reason. is courageous.
Ridiculous This has always been about money for this dough bag!
Is it really a good idea to participate in the ? Why must we stop buying a brand?
Boycotting and destroying clothes because of who they represent or an advert. With that in mind lets all stop wearing Hugo Boss because they made the Nazi uniform!
have gone too far now. Basically, they are just laughing at us.
while I applaud the ad, you still need to address poor wages & working conditions overseas. you even more so FYI for those interested, mostly manufactures in the US and Europe.
Well they might just be wrong. Pre hours trading on Nike stock is already down....so u guessed wrong... how to invest and make money... buy Nike stock when it's down 30% over the next month....
Everyone going to boycott religion since priest are coming out of the closet on sex crimes on little boys ? Just stupid
Anyone boycotting , there are so many charities I work with who would happily take those treacherous pricey shoes of yours and save you the stress of setting them alight
Seriously fellow conservatives, burning items that you have already bought is not symbolic, it's childish. Like the thing. Grow up. Be conservative for a change.
Colin Kaepernick was riding the bench when this all started. Hes not a hero! He didnt sacrifice ANYTHING! Hes a cop hating, anti-American who just signed a multi million dollar dealLaw enforcement and veterans alike should be outraged
People are really burning over their new ad? Stop it. Donate them to the less fortunate. And grow the fuck up. We obviously are a spoiled nation when we can burn $135 pair or shoes because we're mad.
I'm gonna buy up every Nike product I can lay my hands on & tell my friends to do the same, so there won't be any left for their supporters.
Spare me the phony outrage!!!. We have a man in the White House that is head of a criminal enterprise and denigrates the service of American Military heroes. Hired criminals to run his campaign and is currently under investigation!!
"Susan! Go get my Nike stuff!"
Instead of you Idiots burning & cutting up your shoes & clothes why not do something useful like Donating them!
countless Nikes purchased, you just lost a life long customer
you know whether you agree with his views or not. If you boycott Nike you're doing no better than a communist country you know that. Because the whole point of why this country is founded was be able to voice your opinion. You might not like his opinion.
Do people have anything better to do? Let's boycott everything because why not?
is MUSIC TO MY EARS. I MEAN, WHO THROWS TANTRUMS LIKE TODDLERS BECAUSE A BRILLIANT, EDUCATED, ENLIGHTENED BLACK MAN IS CHOSEN TO GRACE A COVER? ppeps.
Ill never buy another pair of your damn sweat shop trash shoes. never cared about USA anyway
Agreed Kylemy family used to tease me about my lol (because of wages/sweat shops etc) AND DOES need 2 fix that ASAP but I do applaud this
I personally think nike have played a blinder with this... but to those dickheads burning stuff why not just donate them to charity?
none of them burned their harleys LOL manufactures in US and Europe. They deserve props 4 that. Nike needs to do the same OR pay better wages and working conditions. I do applaud the ad tho. baby steps
LMFAO , you guys are ridiculous.... destroying Nike products to support police brutality and discrimination?... Nike isnt taking a lost at all, yall PAID FOR THOSE PRODUCT which went straight to Nike
You know whats evident is that your hate for us out weights your love for vets .. I just invested in Nike last night me and about 1 million other people
The same nike that uses serat shops in asia
that's what has always upset me with They need 2 fix those things, or produce in USA or Europe like do give them cred 4 using in their ads tho. Would be bigger heroes if they addressed wages & working conditions
BREAKING NEWS: Trump struck by lightning while wearing Nike shoes. Suspect last seen in clouds firing lighting bolts from sky.
Took an entire day to decide on these shoes only to have to take them back. Not because of the , but because my kid called them 'mom shoes'.
I'm waiting to see a video of a Trump supporter setting fire to his Nike trainers while wearing them ..
the company that made the name "sweatshops" famous are now seeking the "woke" high-ground....
I can't participate in the current because I've been participating in one for over a decade. Why? They have child labor and shipped jobs overseas.
Nike should really take this opportunity to sponsor firewood. Win-win situation for everyone
For all yall racist people participating in the , just drop the shoes off to your local charity. I will continue to add to my shoe collection. AND you're problematic. Still turning the conversation into flag disrespect, when it's about police brutality.
Tough thing to do. Big time Nike Fan. I have Nike golf gear, Nike just about everything. For the kooky left that says Conservatives are not compassionate. I got three bags of Nike gear ready to go to be donated. Nike moving forward will not get another dime from me.
Just Do It For $0.23 Per Hour So We Don't Have to Pay an American Worker
If anyone has any Nike SBs or 6.0s they do not want because of the boycott. This guy will take em.
would pick Kaepernick?Because Kaepernick is anti-Police and anti-AmericaIf Kaepernick was pro America and pro Police he would be tossed away. America
I swear if the people taking part in the were smart, they'd be dangerous.
All products out of my house. Tired of supporting a group of disrespecting entities
Just do it. Well I just did it! I vowed that I will never ever spend one red cent on any product that Nike makes because they stuck their politically correct noses into my wallet. THE END.
I agree with .... this is .... how many are really destroying their own products just to show their angry about something they pretend like they dont understand much less care about .... ....
There are a lot of football teams sponsored by and I have yet to see any pictures or videos of people destroying their jerseys and gear. Just an observation.
Then he should have used an appropriate platform and certainly not kneeled to the American flag.
Nike will see what a fuckup he is. Sit back and wait, it's just a matter of time. Kappadick will be the next Jared of Subway.
is really a thing! this white tears are hilarious. Hey Nike already got yalls money
Gonna set these on fire just to see which side gets more upset.
It's sad how an iconic American company like chose an anti American football player who doesn't respect the US flag to represent their brand.
Im not cutting my socks or pants but I fully support the movement
ppl are destroying their own Nike gear (that they paid for) because Nike signed Kaepernick to....what? own the libs? lol. Yes, please stop..."owning us".
Burning products youve already purchased is just asinine!
no stuff ever never again! This was a very wrong decision from the company NIKE towards all who served the USA army - AND THERE FAMILIES , now and in the past! Trow your stuff in the sales... for your liberal buyers;)
Anyone throwing away their sneakers, Im a size 10.5 and could really use a pair of sneakers. A lot has happened financially over the past several months and Im without any. Just saying. Charity comes from the heart.
Im amazed to see so many conservatives who  for the past two years have done little else but claim liberals are so easy to trigger  are destroying things they own in a dramatic fashion because a man they dont like is in a ad.
There is reason he is not playing in the , You will loose big time on this one, You just lost a third of your fans, relax man check Canada out for a few years come back when your good and this thing blows over......
Sweet! Hopefully the prices will drop! People always boycotting something, try boycotting racism and injustice to all people!
fuck outta here. You dweebs couldn't, wouldn't, and won't boycott Nike. Even if you knew how. Most of you who're "boycotting" BOUGHT Nike to burn it on your lawns. Jackasses. I hope your houses burn down faster than the time it takes to light your tiki torch.
What did you ever sacrifice? You got paid handsomely by a child labor abuser . What a hypocrite! Do child laborer's lives matter to you?
Nike: Appoints Colin Kapernick as a spokesman - "How dare they disrespect veterans, I'm boycotting them"Adidas and Puma: Had its factory used by the Nazis to make anti-tank weapons during WWII- "Absolutely fine"
Lubbock Tx ..u know I say Truth about u everyday 2 everyone..that u r sicko sadist sexual preds..pedos & serial murderers..why so silent? Let's just get oig to clear the air so u can b clean n court
I SUPPORT YOU COLIN! I WILL PROUDLY TAKE A KNEE WITH YOU! ANYWHERE AND ANYTIME. THANK YOU!
Since the racists part of America are Bashing for signing let all black men and women show these bastards that the world has moved on without em ...Say no to Racism.. Everybody should just retweet please
We the American People and lovers of this land and followers of our Lord and Savior , taking our Country back from you Satanic assholes!
Nike u lost me as a customer until ur poster chiller Kaepernick is taken down.
Im old enough to remember when evangelical churches held bonfires to burn Beatles records after Lennon made a crack about the Beatles being more popular than Jesus. That really showed those stupid Beatles whos boss, didnt it?
I havent bought Nike in forever and this just makes it more of a reason not to!
Burn your  clothes everyone. Just Do It!
Take a knee has no business being a promoted during a football game for which the players are paid a pretty penny by the fans of NFL. If 's convictions were honest, he would take up his cause any number of different ways.
If Hillary alone beat the boy with over 1m votes, then what will happen when Nike gets Hillary plus NFL gang? I repeat if Hillary alone beat the boy with over 1m votes, then what will happen when Nike gets Hillary plus NFL gang clients?
If Hillary alone beat the boy with over 1m votes, then what will happen when Nike gets Hillary plus NFL gang? I repeat if Hillary alone beat the boy with over 1m votes, then what will happen when Nike gets Hillary plus NFL gang clients?
It's interesting that people are willing to boycott Nike because an overpaid athlete took a knee, but they're not willing to boycott Nike over making children work as slaves to make the shoes they wear? Hypocritical much?
People are really out here burning Nike shit because their feelings are hurt and because of this fake Sense of Patriotism they have
The grandsons of the greatest generation that stormed Normandy are...cutting up their socks because they're offended by something.
must have never heard of Pat Tillman; someone who truly sacrifised all.
Anyone else more inclined to buy just to piss off the raging spunktrumpets that are cutting the labels out because of ?Love him, love what he stands (or kneels) for and love his 'fro. He is, to me, a sporting hero. I salute you.
MAGAts can't cut the out of their wives' socks because they keep them barefoot.
this about 's hate for or for when you a athlete. all you dream about is the nike sponsor deal? now people are ape-shit over a social commentary/concern, knee?good on nike 4 supporting the anti-discrimination and anti-racism movement?
I dont care I was buying overpriced products who where made in sweatshops overseas by children... but to make a campaign using Colin Kaepernick is unacceptable!
..just do it !!
Because of and in support of here is my response.
I find it hilarious that when the news cycle goes quiet people look for a reason to fight each otherSecondly, why must every aspect of American patriotism be dedicated to the military? I would like to think that theres more to America than big guns
..just do it !!
People are burning shoes that were put together in a Chinese sweatshop for pennies, and sold to them for hundreds of dollars, capitalism at its finest!
I just texted my son,( away at college,) that I'd but him whatever items he wanted
Not now not ever just do it with Nike.
..just do it !!!
Ive started calling this Hoboing your clothing.Cletus: Hey man I just Hoboed my socks to own the libs!Justathin: Yeah I just Hoboed my favorite Nike sweater. Im sure those libs are super sad now!
. features 's Kaepernick in 'Just Do It' campaign "Just Do" WHAT?? Piss on the flag? Insult Americans? Annoy the crap out of fans? Good luck with that
Ive started calling this Hoboing your clothing.Cletus: Hey man I just Hoboed my socks to own the libs!Justathin: Yeah I just Hoboed my favorite Nike sweater. Im sure those libs are super sad now!
I've done this for many yrs now. Over priced china crap. Now just another reason not buy their crap.
Who the fuck wears shoes anyways? They are the cheapest made shoes on the market. Want a real shoe? Buy they don't shit on the flag and they use GOOD materials.
If Hillary alone beat the boy with over 1m votes, then what will happen when Nike gets Hillary plus NFL gang? I repeat if Hillary alone beat the boy with over 1m votes, then what will happen when Nike gets Hillary plus NFL gang clients?
Two days ago Conservatives were making fun of Liberals for not eating at . Now theyre burning their 150 dollar pair of shoes in the front yard because of a man in an ad...
Y'all can talk that B.S all you like! There are w-a-y more Black supporters, than there are sneaker burning loser-idiot's....."Trust Bruv"
A lot of UK folk in faux outrage about a guy I suspect they've never heard of
If Hillary alone beat the boy with over 1m votes, then what will happen when Nike gets Hillary plus NFL gang customers?
And i just bought the trump tower and given to to Nike to display their mechandise! and if Hillary alone beat the boy with over 1m votes, then what will happen when Nike gets Hillary plus NFL gang?
"I used to be a football player. Now I make millions to have my picture taken."Yeah, nobody feels sorry for you, Junior Castro.
Sorry was I supposed to do something?I was busy watching Broncos game while eating an while wearing this gear
Has Phil Knight become a Liberal & Muslim? Does Phil hate America like Colin Kaepernick? WAR HEROS MAKE THE 'SACRIFICE".......Colin never will!
Welp, it's almost like a private business can present any image it wants?
Because of kaepernick?
Always loved your music, now I love you! Thank you for your stance on this!
Official nfl apparel supplier, almost all production overseas, retailers that want delivery in July '19 (biggest wholesale shipping month for nfl) orders must be placed Nov/Dec '18...as nfl will be less popular, USA focus Great Awakening, their '19 nfl sales =
IKR? Laughing my head off at all the people burning their socks - the ones that they've already paid for. Like Nike hasn't factored losing their custom into the equation.
When are these people ever going to learn, there are more of us who can actually AFFORD to buy these products as opposed to those who let the govt take care of them.
Imagine boycotting a company just because you disagree with them politically
Hell yeah dude I just got to support the
The pig socks boy got a new gig from . Watch bring the stock down in a few hours. is a low life, entitled rich boy. Thanks for pouring gasoline on the turnout for us! A real turnout machine!
Trump supporting racists today
These guys found out Jesus liked brown immigrant people so they pulled a Nike hating burning shoes
got ridiculed, mocked, and attacked for praying to Jesus. you chose the wrong person.
All of this because a black person wore ...Uh... Censored the last picture for obvious reasons.
Okay, be pissed off at all you want. You do you.Why couldn't you give those shoes to charity? Someone in need could of really used them.
A little something that I worked on over le summer. Who would you like to say this to? (The list of mine currently includes the panicked people who support because of 's new ad.)
All you conservatives getting your undies in a bundle over Nike (I neither agree nor disagree) but you still support companies like Bayer who created the gas for the nazis.. wtf?
When you rip or destroy your personal property of what ever buisness you don't support anymore, you just make yourself look dumb, and there is no such thing as bad publicity so keep giving money lol you played yourself lol
Imma just leave this here.
Being from Mississippi we are raised a certain way but not all of us. I work with veterans daily and they do find it utterly disrespectful so instead of focusing on Rosa / lets look Watching this did not really change my opinion
I just dont know how a sports brand survives losing the coveted white people who cant run 10 feet without getting winded demographic.
Doesn't it make the Left just a little bit uncomfortable when they and the worst Tyrants in the world agree on so many issues?
Oy !!! You just sold me a pair of shoes! Well Done!
Colin Kaepernick has no idea what sacrifice means. The shareholders of are about to find out, however. But what's a couple billion in market value? Small price to pay to fan the flames of racism and divide people.
Just seen is the face of 's 30th anniversary campaign. and his ilk will not be happy. Even seen that really, really, really stupid people are burning their stuff. is even a now, good luck with that you morons.
LOL! It was a great move by to use as the face of their brand, but it may turn into even a better move for if it inspires a significant . It's interesting how many are willing to risk for these days.
Wow!, Just send them to me, Dont burn them!
Nike is under cabal control. We must do what we have done superbly and repeatedly: CRUSH sales. Fly, my pretties.

DONE BUYING NIKE! It was bad enough that he gave Governor Kate Brown $25 thousand, but now PHIL KNIGHT HAS COME OUT AS A DAMN LIBERAL! No respect for America!
RTd because is life
