This one white dude burnt his feet to spite his shoes (that he paid good money for). White supremacy is a hell of a drug!
Oh I thought were done trashing a former POW during his funeral and were back to pretending it's black people who are the unpatriotic ones.
Cant wait for white people to realize nike owns converse.
We finally got RACIST white folks to stop saying a N word
White people please stop calling Nike disrespectful. They love the military!!
Its 2018... why are we STILL having to deal with racism? Grow up and be decent human beings! We are all equal!
Ive been going through the posts and its all old white women. You expect me to believe that you put on your velociraptor toes? I dont think so.
Before you feel bad for someone's "sacrifice" dont forget he would have a job with the Baltimore ravens if his girl friend didn't tweet racist shit to the owner. let's keep the blame game rolling !!!
ite Obama is behind . hypocrite. Obama reperesents white rich spokeperson in wallstreet while negleting actual fighter part of 13 hours benghazi. Trump listened workers in trash condition while Obama is Anti-police pro-communism on national labor day
watching angry racists burning their nikes they already paid for. why are you so smart?
I want to be appalled at the but I cant. Its not like Colin had a detailed conversation with a soldier to understand the best way to express himself without disrespect. What was that black guy thinking taking all that white money and having an opinion.
Racism nowadays comes out the asscracks of the country when POC are placed on display, as if white privilege doesnt open enough doors
What exactly does walking around with holes in your clothes prove except you're a racist moron
One thing the proves is that racism is stupid and so are racists.
You know what is honestly terrible, Donald Trump Father fleeing the U.S and getting arrested in his home country for fleeing war! White ppl are controversial AF.
Brenda Hamilton Would you walk in Colin Kaepernick's shoes? I would not. It is not a race issue.
I pulled out the wit the cool colors today we see you out there I call these my saved my the bell ish Mcflys lol
Perhaps racism is bad for branding and Nike is well rid of you?
Great, now I have to go spend $100 on sneakers so I don't look like a racist. Thanks .
The type of nikes these white folks out here burning them bitches need to be burnt
Black People : No CapRacist: No Kaep
- taking advantage of women and child slave labor in underdeveloped countries since the 1970's.where is ?
This is going around but I don't know who to give credit too - "Y'all ready to boycott Nike over a black guy, but wont boycott the Catholic Church for fucking yalls kids."
Me walking pass all the angry white people in my nikes
All you racist burning your shoes Im a size 7 send em my way ayyyy
Seems to be a lot of white guys burning their Nikes today...
so this doesnt apply to the black delegation . carry on
Tired of having to destroy your clothing items in an act of anti-Blackness, thinly veiled by your obsessive love of the flag? Donate your shoes and other items to the Veterans you so deeply love today! ‚Å† ‚Å†
Nike corporation does not understand American values, they treat their foreign contractors as slaves
white folks gotta realize they finna be the only mfs out here wit no drip
White racist Americans burning stuff reminds me of something..cant put my finger on it
White folks looking at a fresh pair of nikes
Poor Colin Kaepernick. He lived in a 17,000 square foot home and he sold it for a measly 3.075 million. In 2016, he bought a New York condo for $3.21 million.Such sacrifice on his part. And yes, this is what oppression looks like!
/3 "I am not going to stand up to show in a for a country that oppresses black people & people of color," told Media. "To me, this is bigger than & it would be selfish on my part to look the other way.
Nike equals garbage
Yall tryna boycott Nike and the NFL over a black guy but dont do shit about the Catholic Church fucking kids? And you finna tell me its about the flag and veterans smh
So it's racially motivated marketing? Good to know!
Big and Rich more like Bigot and Bitch ?
Ppl really showing their racist ass with this
If you're burning or done with your clothing, then there may be some racism hiding inside of you. Check your self not
White people are salty
is the proof that racist white trash still think they can do anything after electing Trump... Like making Nike care for them LOL
I challenge you as a white person to stop being racist. Thank you. From a black person.
Any white conservatives wanting to burn your gear, your welcome to give it to me... or better yet, veterans you pretend to care about.
Dump your stock while you're at it, that way I can buy it at discount. Come on sell it off! Doesn't it make you angry what that colored uppity black boy did sell your stock, first thing in AM.
Have you researched ALL products that you own to see if they follow your racist beliefs? You can't take a stand by picking and choosing. It's all or none
White people swear they more Americans than anyone else. Lmao im investing in
Burn those God damn New Balances that y'all White racist ppl love to wear.
What a DISGRACE you have become!
Here's a short list of things to be madder at than the :- Catholic Priests molesting kids- Mass/School Shootings- Flint, MI STILL doesn't have clean water- Police brutality- Domestic Violence- Sexual Assault- Crumbling Infrastructure- NFL teams pay no taxes
are many people out there - adults, children, families - who do not have the luxury to destroy their own clothes. Donate your Nike clothes and shoes to Goodwill, Salvation Army, or other organizations who serve underprivileged members of your communities.
You know the people that are burning their NIKE have never been broke in their lives. Literally spoiled white people who would rather burn their stuff than donate it to the homeless veterans theyre protecting ok pal is dumb get over yourselves.
Dear Racists: If you're looking to get rid of your Nikes, I'm a size 10.5. Send me a DM.
Im gonna make fun of angry racists being angry about racist shit. Im gonna be black. Unapologetically and full of excellence. If my blackness makes you uncomfortable, leave.
All the ignorant white trash racists spearheading this are morons. I think I'm gonna go buy some new Nike shoes, and maybe even buy stock in Nike.I'm proud to stand with them. And .
Why is it that people's 1st thought is to go out & buy merchandise in response to the ? How does that stop police/judicial violence against Black people in this country? Have we forogtten about the sweatshops?
Nike, the official sponsor of Black Lives Matter
Simple mind. Not wearing Nike equals not advertising for them!
white people mad Nike made Kaepernick the new face of their brand so they burn the cloths and shoes they already purchased
Do old, white, fat senior citizens wear Nikes? I thought they wore those wide, white or off-tan hospital shoes. The young overwhelming side with Kaepernick, BLM, and progressive ideals. Nike knows this.
looks like you have an anti-American racist running your marketing department. tbh, I've never purchased anything made by Asian slaves from your sweatshop factories, and its certain I never will.
So basically, everyone kicking off and boycotting are a bunch of ‚Äòpatriotic racists? Have I got that in a nutshell? I think so.
Remember kids,Racists are idiots.
To all of the players with college football programs that have their attire sponsored by , NOW might be a good time to stand your ground and participate in a by placing a piece of black tape over each and every 'swoosh' for this week's game.
If Kappernick loved all blacks, then he would be creating jobs for them, like President is.
Racists are gunna have no swag now lmaoooooo
hey if youre participating in the Nike Boycott: Im a size 9 in womens and i dont have a color preference hmu
If Kappernick loved all blacks, then he would be creating jobs for them, like President Trump is.
Most of the white folks boycotting Nike dont even do shit Athletic.
So, from what I am seeing, if the person is a soldier/police officer/fireman and also white they get to have "Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything" said about them. 1/2
Expand racists ...
So far most of the shoes Ive seen burning look like the kind of white leather dad shoes typically worn with dark dress socks. Nike should definitely apologize. Those things are embarrassing.
This is why the is Racist & Dumb, Colin Kaepernick is the KEY!
It's only a matter of time before Linda Sarsour, representing the epitome of oppression for women will be the next new face for Nike's new campaign.
Me making racists mad whenever I pop out with all my Nike on
Incre√Øble que el racisme estiga tan present als EUA.
The funniest thing about this whole is the repeated copy and pasting of the "white people and sears" post. If you're going to be edgy, you might want to come up with your own material.
These white folks burning nike gear are called trumptards for a reason.
Do white people still wear Hurleys? Lmao burn them shits too, & your Chucks!
Nike sells most of it's shoes to young black men. is a JOKE lmao....If I see another Wannabe Army poser screaming bs in a SUV about Kapernick I'm gonna puke...
But for real tho. You'll still look like a racist but at least you won't look like a racist ASSHOLE
Crosses, books, and now shoes. You racist bags of shit better stay away from marshmallows.
more people have voiced how they feel about with then they have for police brutality and the reason he took a knee in the FIRST place
Hooray for virtue signalling by a company that markets shoes to poor kids and pays its child employees 20 cents a day in order to have enough cash left over to employ a millionaire fighting oppression.
will only last until these morons realize theyve torched all their whitey tighties.
For you white supremacists.
Racists don't wear Nike.
If Kappernick loved all blacks, then he would be creating jobs for them, like President Trump is.
Does this include ? Thats is Nike yall white folks burning your Jordans to
this has to be one of the most dumbest hashtags. You dont want anything Nike? Fine. Take your racist money elsewhere. But dont be stupid and burn and throw away shit you bought already.
All that slave labor going up in smoke.Sad.In full disclosure, I only wear Shells.
Yall ready to boycott Nike over a black man, but wont boycott the Catholic Church for messing w/ yalls kids....
oh by the way Nike really dont care about the opinions of small minded racist in fact they never cared
I'll be boycotting Nike. What other country allows you the privilege of making millions of dollars playing sports...or getting adopted (Kaepernick) by a wonderful loving family that can provide you with everything you need? Show respect
It's a terrible message coming from who is racist, disrespects women, People of color and is constantly caught lying. And you think you can talk about & do your thing Brother
How is That going you racist fucks This was in 24hours
Im wit Steven Jackson on this one.. THANK YOU to anyone burning their Nike gear! Show your true colors.. Itll be a lot easier to spot a racist now that yall are willing to segregate yall selfs off a logo
Everybody thats burning their Nike outfits,shoes,and more are racist AF. If you cant understand why people kneel than your the problem not him or anyone else that kneels.
White people BIG MAD today for nothing
, this is what you represent. Racism,bigotry, ignorance and intolerance..sad
man all these white people in this tag are hella pressed lol
Yall ready to boycott Nike over a black guy, but wont boycott the Catholic Church for fucking yalls kids.
Of course racist of who calls owners plantation owners like what did. And I wish would stop being afraid to disagree on racial,issues with
Shh Nike doesnt want you to know its a big marketing gag . If you hate Trump white folk the flag and cops buy Nike .
White ppl mad hahaha is funny and dont make no sense but I still love yall
I think that company is anti-American. They have slave shops in China make shoes at subpar quality and sell them a hundred fold more than the cost of them . I have kids in sports , that will be the last pair of Nike I buy.
Black Folk: Pay CLOSE attention to your Hwite FRIENDS who are suddenly boycotting ..if they KNOW the reason Kap kneeled to begin with, and have a problem with it, they secretly have a problem with you being alive
Raised by white parents. is a fraud and blacks fall for his BS
If burning Nike objects was a yankee candle scent itd be called white privilege
has me thinking. Whether you agree with how the message is conveyed or not, you cant deny what Kaepernick, Bennet, Long, Jenkins and others are fighting for. Youve either got to be naive, overly privileged, dense or a racist to be against what their message is.
The funniest shit about the is all these old racist white men bout to pick up Atlanta trap slang "No Kap"
Uhhhh if any white folks that's burning their Nike gear got them Kyrie Lucky Charms or Fade to Black Kobe's hmu I'll buy them
When people show you who they are, believe them. The police officers can stop with the lie that most are good and dont harbor prejudices. More proof that they arent interested in applying the law equally.
Dear racist white ppl, yall look like idiots burning up yall Nikes. Yall dont buy the raw kind anyway
This isn't the first time that flag waving transparent bigotry has called itself patriotism.
Lucha contra el racismo, racismo y marcas de consumo como identidad.
newsflash to all racists! destroying nike products that you already purchased does nothing but show your (ugly) ignorance! if you truly care about an issue, remember to vote and contact your local legislators! thanks!
I will never buy Nike again. They are racist cop haters
I don't hate on Kapernick or Nike but there are other players who have beaten the odds and came up from poverty to fame in sports.
To all the racist white peole destroying nike gear, its too late you bought it.
I wish people put more effort into what people stand for, rather than taking the time and effort ripping fucking logos off of them. Of course, leave it up to angry people to show their true colors amongst it all.
Racism needs to take a knee during the national anthem! Then maybe they will boycott racism
Sorry go sell crazy somewhere else. No-one needs to see U crying about Yall dont do sh*t for the veterans - all talk. Its time someone takes a stand against you racist AHoles. How about you post a video with you doing something for veteran ?
Nike could care less what you racist burn!! Most of the shit yall burning Nike have to Walmart for the discount tables
anyone planning to burn or throw away sum offwhite x nike shoes?? donate them to me pls
Colin Kaepernicks direct actions blew up into something big. Never underestimate white supremacys obsession of power through symbols. Never.
Did WEALTHY, PRIVILEGED SNOWFLAKE Colin Kaepernick, Now at the Center of Nike Scandal, Actually Sacrifice Anything?
The racist paradox
Wonder if shes gonna do blackface for this one?
To all the racist, uneducated, trump loving dickheads who are burning their shoes.. we know that yall so ignorant to ignore climate change bc mr. potato head says its fake news but, please, burning your shoes is bad for the environment. U know.. pollution.
Liberal moron. Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker Rahm Emanuel Parkland Trump did not utter the full statement, "Laziness is a trait in blacks"
Totally sick of this youre white youre black shit. Its all Ive heard all day concerning and his Nike deal. Racism starts at home, people arnt born racist!!! Get the fuck over it and start educating your kids!!
Huge props to theyre Colin Kaepernick campaign is a stroke of brilliance for shaking racist dead weight off its wagon making room for feet & voices that really matter
Disgraceful at best to back this idiot! is Dead!
white people talking about , meanwhile theyre nikes come from shoe carnival
Two things:1. It's a Privilege to be able to burn shoes and have more left.2. Nike is a GLOBAL company. That means it is bigger than America.
Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker Rahm Emanuel Parkland Who were the slaves that helped keep runaways on the plantation, again? Remember what they were called?
Fuck anti-American slavery enabler Nike!
really screwed the pooch with kaepernick. Nike represents athletes. Like jordan. Respectable people. Now they wanna represent cry baby america hating race pimps. Never again will i ever buy
The worst part about being racist is that now I have to burn my brand new Jordans I bought for my last paycheck.
White People note to you ...you dont spend more money on clothes and shoes than black people ...its not even close ...
People mad at Nike and the kneeling NFL players are showing fake outrage. If they really wanted the kneeling to stop and really loved the flag and what it stands for they would be mad about how people are treated unfairly based on skin color.
White people have me laughing with this
Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker Rahm Emanuel Parkland That is correct. Without racism who would need a Democrat?
White people appear to be burning their sneakers and clothes while they are wearing them rather than face the facts of racism. Our society is a white, Christian, male, heterosexual supremacy that hurts people. Face it and change it.
Ive come to the understanding that people in AmeriKKKa do not know the meaning of Patriotism which shows their racism
Yall ready to boycott Nike over a black guy, but wont boycott the Catholic Church for fucking yalls kids.
Yall worried about when White on White violence is about to be on the rise and bout to start some shit.
Nike is a disgrace for aligning itself with former NFL player Kaepernick. Join to express your outrage.
As a guy I say Old angry white guys are not a core demographic for Nike.
Why would care about a when everyone already knows that white nationalists wear New Balance?
My only takeaway from this sneaker-burning is that angry white dudes have terrible taste when picking sneaker models. ?
Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker Rahm Emanuel Parkland Who said racism does not exist?Democrats need racism, they keep it alive.
continues to not give a fuck about peoples opinions and shed light on important issues. This truly shows how uneducated and racist people are. I however will KEEP buying Nike Products and encourage others to as well.
Medger Evans served in the military and white people still killed him and did nothing to solve his murder
Such a dick, ultimate display of white privilege. If you had any idea what it was like to fear for your life everyday.
If you are doing the / , I'm happy to get rid of any size 13 Jordans you may have. Especially the rare colorways - I'm an expert at getting rid of those. DM me!
White ppl and racist why does this bother you so? Its hypocritical to shun someone for what he believes in and in a peaceful way at that but when yall believe in something yall get angry and burn shit up. That's a big difference?
A stupid publicity stunt aimed and the uneducated. will suffer and people will cry racism. Colin is a good and nothing close to a role model. Buy
got the racist like
When dubbed a black boy the coolest monkey in the jungle that was cool & people were over reacting BUT a black man does the most American thing by standing for his beliefs even if it meant losing everything. Nike recognized it & yall want to ?
Oh shit a black woman as well
All of you Nike Air Monarch dad's rejoice your savior is here. Burn those boring Nike's & buy yourself a REAL pair of white dad shoes the . I can gurantee you No Bitches & No Booty with these beauties.
I wish people who are joinimg the would get equally as angry that is an Unindicted Co-Conspirator in felony Election Law crimes.
Nike bout to be the only N word white people stop saying
stand up to police brutality
Hey , , check out and see what wounded white supremacy racism looks like... daamn! Thats psychosis!!!
Looks like you pissed off people who really dont care for black people Yea that sounds more like the historical and present truth
Ironic that the guy who supposedly is against oppression is taking money and is the face of a company known to produce many of their goods in some of the worst sweat shops.
White people wear nike wrong any way
"Millions" of angry white dudes who don't understand the actual issue. Well, at least now they will have something legitimate to be angry about, since their socks are FOR SURE gonna fall down under the heels now. That's definitely anger worthy.
I hope all you dumb fucking lemmings like walking barefoot. Nike owns Converse, Jordans, and Hurley. Adidas owns Reebok, Rockport, Taylor made. Gucci owns Puma. It would be cooler if you gave a shit about black people this much.
What is he doing for the poor black folks living in cities ruined by Democrats?
Anyone got a pair of Nike x Off-White Air Prestos? Im a size 9.5 or 10.
boycott uno mans trying to finesse the offwhite vapormax
found this nytimes article talking about Nikes unfair work conditions and how unsafe there factorys are for there slaves
You really are a racist if you
Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker Rahm Emanuel White liberals really know how black folks are supposed to act, we are so lucky.
chega a ser rid√≠culo ver esses racistas de bosta criticando a campanha da Nike com o
Nothing empowers a privileged African-American sportsperson more than wealth derived from slavery.
You are all ready to boycott over a black guy, but wont boycott the for molesting your kids
's crazy how Racist America‚Ñ¢ has been gas lighting everyone w/"the kneel".It's been how long since that movement started to get the point across for change?how many times has it been reiterated that it has NOTHING to do w/ disrespecting the flag/soliders/america
I was never a big Nike fan but now I know that it annoys gammon faced racists, I'll be decked out in a Nike tracksuit in no time.
The NFL in damage control at this point in my opinion. No reason why this man shouldve been blacked balled. No reason why Capital Hill needed to intervene. This is consequential of the nature of the issue at hand.
Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker Rahm Emanuel White liberals... clinically simple or willfully deranged?
can't wait til the part of your campaign where tours your sweat shops to promote "equality"
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker White liberals... they still think they own minorities.
Always remember the silencefrom when police were killing unarmed black males who spend the most on gear. Where were those magazines 2yrs ago in the Prime of everything lol now they wanna come around when its a lil safer fck outta here
Lol, what does burning your clothes do against ?... all you doing is showing the world youre a racist.... Like why? What is the rational ? even boycott Nike? Lol ??
Let me get this straight...Conservatives are boycotting Nike over a black guy on one knee.So, why aren't they boycotting the Catholic Church for fucking children?
Racist Rubes and their
soooo people really burning/ruining the nike gear they BOUGHT to make their white ass statement?
Lol, the whites are at it again
Hillary's mentor and his friends were burning crosses on black people's lawns - everyone cool with it. We burn a few shitty shoes & all the tradcucks be triggered
remember that democrat's thugs murdered & will still murder ppl for wearing nike "collectibles" like air jordans, etcbut rt wingers who partake in are 'racists'
Thank you Black Twitter
Police Brutality.... Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker
Maybe you thought signing the cop hating, race baiting failed football player would help sales ? Our staff of military veterans will never purchase your shoes again
If only the people so mad about Kaepernick being a part of Nike would get this upset about police brutality.
Instead of yall throwing away or burning Nike items. Give them to the men and women you so called care about! Those at war and vets! Yall need to stop! Yall white robes are starting to rip through your political suits..
All these white really mad at nike Im finna be dripped in Nike this Fall
if it were a white men the kneeled or was on Nike Campaign would really be Boycotting them ?
The fact the national police association trying boycott over something like this and not when cops repeatedly get off for murdering black people os why this world is so upside down
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker I love being schooled by a white liberal on how I am supposed to speak, think and act... black folks sure are lucky to have white liberals!
Nobody cares that you are burning them old ass dirty Sears outlet Nikes definitely doesn't even remember making them wack ass Nikes. It was time for a new pair anyway with your racist asses
Women make .20 cents an hour. doesn't care about equality. where is your voice for inequality.
Nike is gonna be the only N-word white people stop saying
Im tryna see someone set fire to their off whites or red Octobers come on
With this going on I hope all their off-white shit goes on sale
Not bad... only 3.16% of Nike share holders were bigots
Yall ready to boycott Nike over a black guy, but wont boycott the Catholic Church for fucking yalls kids.
honestly you should be more mad retired the carbon fiber color. the new grey isnt it
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Cory Booker Facts are facts: White liberals know how blacks are supposed to behave, think and speak.
White people are hella mad at Nike lmfaooo
for God sake, please give resignation form the post. You are ruining everything. You are disgrace to humanity, world and everything. Shame... Kaepernick ad spurs Nike boycott campaign
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme Court Only white liberals and morons say some black people 'act white', which are you?
BREAKING: Adidas introduced Merrick Garland as the face of their new ad campaign, ensuring that soon the only viable footwear for bigoted conservative snowflakes will be old Kleenex boxes. ‚Å† ‚Å†
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme Court Specifically, white Democrats.
Its scary to know that racism is being disguised as patriotism now. Fuck the
The is what racist retards do. If your sick of news always being shit and holding greats like Kap back then come chill and watch me play when I re up my stream in 1 hour and lets forget all the troubles and have a laugh at my skills.
If I had the money, I'd buy some Nike gear. Fucking racist cunts
Kill Nike, and you destroy the Largest Oppressor of people of Color known to man kind. The hypocrisy is so thick you can cut it with a butter knife!
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme Court You mean white Democrats.
Thinking today of all the poor racists who've had to burn their Nikes. There should be some kind of sneaker exchange so they can all receive a new pair of pure white shoes.
I got my all white Air Huarache shoes on today
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme Court White liberals know how blacks are supposed to think, act and speak... let's take note!
Crazy fact but true - most police brutality crimes happen when the victim has clothes on . In this case we should boycott ALL CLOTHES.
The people that are burning their Nike stuff guess what you already bought it. Colin Kaepernick is still going to get his money. The racists are going to be racist no matter what and Nike stocks is not going to go down its going to go up .
if you think there is racism, you are being played and sold what they are selling...which now happens to be sneakers.
Nike Burned by racists since 2018.
nike best ad campaign in years, they got a buncha old white dudes to talk constantly about the brand for a few days $nke
Racists: I'm burning all my stuff! Me:
INTERESTING THAT ALL THE BURNING TRAINERS I SEE ARE SPORTS DIRECT SPECIALS.. HYPOTHESIS: BIGOTS GOT NO SAUCE = PROVEN
It would be amazing if these triggered ass white people from the would donate the shit they dont want to the homeless veterans they love so much but hey I ask for too much to expect these bitchmade snowflakes to think clearly all you like bitches!!
Hey guys check these Equality Nike Dri fit tees out! https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F113229858001¬†
White people gonna be even madder when they kids still asking for the new Lebrons though!
I bet are made up all these racists won't be wearing their clothes or trainers anymore.
When you don't have the financial burden of buying white table clothes and scissors like your parents did in 2018.
Guess this old lady will be giving up her Sketchers and going back to Nike.. ,, Christmas coming up,, nikes for all the kids, nieces, nephews, etc.. And I will never listen to again.. he has shown what a true racist ass he is.. so sad..
is for those who agree with police brutality and systematic racism. By no means is Nike disrespecting our servicemen/women and police
People who say the isn't racist are fools. They are boycotting a company specifically over race. SPECIFICALLY. OVER. RACE. ITS THE DEFINITION OF RACIST.
White people are on a like they are the target market
Are yall worried about the sweatshops or are yall worried about a black man prospering?
Me passing white people on the street with the huge Nike logo on my shopping bag.
If anyone has the Jordan Retro 1 Off White UNCs please send them this way pls tnx
All these white folks out here burning their favorite running shoes and jackets that they ALREADY spent money on THINKING Nike cares STILL GOT YOUR MONEY MAYONNAISE
Complaining about the , But Nikes slave child labor though...
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme Court We should really appreciate white liberals for instructing black folks how they're supposed to speak, think and behave!
White people about to boycott Nike and buy yeezys from adidas
Given people's reactions to the I feel like it's important to note that a politics predicated on Western consumption is a (re)investment in the violent exploitation of Black and Brown people globally.
White people are so quick to but won't boycott the Catholic church for fucking their kids.
has made BILLIONS by sticking names of black athletes on their merch. Most of that revenue came FROM black people. They don't give a DAMN about your little .You are the minority and this is what it feels like to be marginalized. Enjoy your day in the shade.
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme Court Please white liberal, teach me how to speak like a proper, well behaved black person that your sort approve of!
Nothing calms the soul of a racist like seeing something on fire
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme Court White liberals always know how black folk are supposed to think, speak and behave...
Nothing makes me want to wear a brand more than knowing that racist idiots are no longer wearing it.
When you become a public figure for basically being a rare person who agrees with a man that does not respect your color or your gender, you clearly don't do much research! PS. these comments are great!
This reminded me how sad it is that black people can't for being behind ! -
So what shoes are all the white dads going to wear while they're on the grill?
I really don't get what burning your clothes is going to accomplish. You want to show people that you're an idiot and racist?
don't you feel lucky that white liberals make it clear how black folks are supposed to act? Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme CourtSaves a lot of guess work, no?
When youre an angry white conservative and youre so offended by people of color being offended that you burn all your Nike clothing
You people burning and destroying your Nike clothes over couldve instead donated them to unprivileged kids or someone in need. Instead you wanna be soo far up in your own ass about this. You guys lost, lost without even realizing it.
You dont get to drape your racism in the American flag and call it patriotism. NEWSFLASH: were no longer asleep at the wheel.
Aren't we all very lucky that white liberals know how black folks are supposed to speak, think and behave? Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme Court
So if you are against cop killers, that makes you racist, in your opinion?
White people are not going to burn their beloved Air Monarchs bruh.
Ain't nobody mad but white people and the devil!
Man Nikes really gonna miss that 25 dollars your poor white ass spent on an aged out pair at DSW
Anyone tweeting or is ok with systematic racism and police brutality!!! Ill say it again for those who dont get it!!! HE IS AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY AND SYSTEMATIC RACISM...NOT THE FLAG THE ANTHEM OR THE SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN OF THIS COUNTRY!! YW!!
watching racists burn things they already paid for
She's incredibly racist and admits is too.
half white by birth - raised by white parents. Eat shit race baiters

I promise that all the white girlsthat are outraged at Nike about this Kap situation ,will still be wearing Nike shorts and leggings to class for the rest of the semester. yall kill me.
Aren't black folks lucky for the guidance that white liberals provide?Now we know how to think and act properly! What a relief! Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme Court
I dont give a shit about Nike's new ad campaign. Never liked their brand, always kinda thought overly branded merchandise was stupid. I think Colin Kaepernic (howeverthefuck) is an idiot for disrespecting the flag then trying to shoehorn it into police brutality tho.
When MLK marched on Washington, he wasn't disrespecting the road.When Gandhi was on a hunger strike, he wasn't disrespecting food.When knelt during the anthem, he wasn't disrespecting the flag.But please keep burning your feet like the idiots you are
Privilege isnt real! yell people burning Nikes. FYI: This isnt how boycotts work. You already gave them your money.
!!!! : several true American patriots are kickstarting Tiki-Torchers, casual footwear for sub-athletic racists."Don't be shy, light the sky! (: legs may catch on fire)"
Anybody want to get rid of white, black and/or floral women's low Airforce 1's size 8? Asking for a friend who said to tell you she only wants brand new stuff and none of the funky stuff thanks
The has been going on in my life since I left high school & it has nothing to do with politics. We were required to have a white pair for and they were the most uncomfortable I've ever owned. Coming from a person who can wear 4-5 inch heels.
Wow privilege has come to a new level. Millions cant afford to feed their families, yet alone buy NIKE shoes and clothing. Lmk when youre done pouting about people and companies standing up against systematic racism.
So yall would rather be out here setting forest fires instead of torching systemic racism and bigoted beliefs? Wow.
Between the thing and the Em/MGK/G-eazy beef white people are having a moment
I dont believe in disrespecting the symbols that represent the country in which you live, the place where you make millions of dollars playing a sport. It is disgraceful and embarrassing. I will boycott Nike.
Child slavery is real at
For all people that plan on burning their Nikes please know I offer my home as a disposal site & will pass any along to a child, teen, or homeless veteran who doesnt have the privilege to destroy a pair of shoes or clothing.
But it was never about the vets. Its about being uncomfortable that your privilege is being questioned. You all dont care about vets. You care about silencing those who are braver than you.
As long as black dollars are not apart of the Nike will be straight
The ultimate Display of Privilege is lighting new shoes and clothes on fire in an attempt to go viral instead of giving those items to people who desperately need them.
Im telling yall... you better hope on this black excellence train while we still have spots open
Yo white people burning ya shoes and clothes tryna show Nike how you feel. News flash Nike makes they money VIA BLACK PEOPLE. Nike was and will NEEEEEEEEVER be worried about "yall". So you burning shit you already paid for what? Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
Theyre a global company! Yeah, Im sure the black youth around the globe are more well off than in the U.S. and buying up Nikes
I love it when bigoted people are boycotted and their stock falls 4%.rt "The so-called is Helping Nike!" Um hmm...Good. Then more "helping" please.
Colin Kaepernick is outstanding. He's brave. He's inspiring. The only people upset with Kap are low rent, low life, sluggish and slow "proud" white trash Americans. I wouldn't be too worried about these uneducated cavemen types.
The struggle...the sacrifice of growing up in "white privilege"
Once again someone does something good and people are offended by it the country shows his true colors is trending now
Colin Kaepernick is standing up to 19th century slavery by being the face of 21st century slavery.
want to impress me? , rather than showing a pic of your destroyed Nikes , why not show me a pic of you dumping them in a donation box for the poor or needy , associate their brand with poverty while helping the less fortunate , DO BETTER PEOPLE!
RealAlexJones RT: RT WhiteIsTheFury: Internet Strikes Back Against Failed Nike Campaign
Some of these white folk about to switch to their own brand of shoes KKKswiss
I'm blaming you for ... you started this unnecessary ass racist ass boycott .. It's your fault. Meanwhile Flint still needs water. Puerto Rico is still without electricity but yet ppl burning Nike .
yeah white people and anyone who is pressed over this nike bs. If you dont want ya Nike's ill gladly take em off your hands, since you wanna be headasses and burn them and ruin them.
I always believed that these companies only care about MONEY .. and the fact is, racist white people aint good money no more
Nike wanted to stop producing these, I see the vision RT : White ppl out here burning they white guy 3000s
$nke stock is only down almost 3% today. Hmm, America is not as racist as I thought lol
White ppl out here burning they "white guy 3000s"
Youre lips are trying very hard to say the words , but that sound that keeps coming out of your mouth is White Power
White people are unseasoning Nikes now
My new column tells a truth about the Colin Kaepernick story the PC sports media doesn't want to tell you. It blows apart the myth that he's being blackballed for activism & outlines a VERY different narrative about what REALLY went down here.
'm a Black man and I have absolutely no respect for Kaepernick. The NFL players league literally represent hundreds of millions of dollars collectively. There are TONS of constructive things they could do to help, kneeling in not one of them!
I swear y'all white folks love to burn shit when you get mad! Crosses, black people, and now shoes!
Educated White folks, thats been exposed to different cultures, is less likely to stand behind racial influenced agendas. Its always the trailer park trash that stirs up the controversy out of ignorance.
I will take everything that I have with NIKE and put it in a black bag and Throw into the GarBage
calling for a are like non-whites calling for a confederate flag boycott.
If youre offended by being the face of Nike.. youre racist. Thats really all there is to it.
all the racist white dipshits boycotting, Huh?
has really highlighted twitters racists today. This has got to me all day.
Yall ready to boycott Nike over a black guy, but wont boycott the Catholic Church for fucking yalls kids
"Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything." was never about the troops.It was never about the flag.It has always been about drawing attention to the modern day lynchings for black folk.
Legions of emotional white men are lighting their shoes on fire at this very moment like they're Angela Bassett in Waiting to Exhale.
Yet to see 1 Person of color to say that theyre boycotting Nike.
Shit bout to be as effective as white southerners boycotting Hamilton as though they would a) get a ticket and b) go to New York to see it. Sign me up for some and gear.
People are doing a like Nike's trying to target to old ignorant white guys anyway
Ive been ever since 2014, I Found out about Sweatshops overseas, Person making the shoes make 20 cent a day, MODERN DAY SLAVERY! Wonder if and other athletes Taking about EQUALITY! Will touch on that???
If youre burning your Nike, youre racist. NO KAP! Dont argue with me either. Youre straight racist and thats it.
Um, I was boycotting Nike already until they make some shoes that appeal to me. Am i now considered a racist?
White folks pissed at Nike and want to boycott, yet yall be mute af when your fellow human beings are slaughtered by the police. Oh okay. From the bottom of my heart: fuck you.
Coincidence that all the I see being burned are the classic middle aged white dad ones?
Don't worry we got you!! -Black Dollars
White niggas be makin the world a less masculine place smh
looks like racist America has come out to play once again.
To all those on this , I guess you hate that black people are breathing, too!
s/o to all the brave whites burning their stuff! truly moving, dare i say more moving than idk, donating it to the veterans youre outraged about? congrats on your new ankle socks ig
Maybe all these douchebag lookin ass dumbass white people partaking in the will Stop wearing their socks AS DRESS SOCKS.
White men all over America are shook and sad they wont be able to wear these again
Hopefully all the sneaker heads boycott Nike so I can finally cop me some off-whites
!!!! It's easier to burn shoes than crosses I see !!! Let's go White Power show em who run this shit ... Shouts to the !! I see y'all
WHY DO WE ALL WAYS HAVE TO CATER TO SOME PEOPLES POINT OF VIEW INSTEAD OF THE TRUTH!RACISM NEEDS TO END!
If I was a huge corporation looking to expand market for the future, I'd trade old&white for young&diverse any fucking day of the week
Hey racists, those Nike shoes could also be put at the bottom of the crosses you burn. Easy to keep the fire going!
How about the one question that relates to , when will black people be treated like humans in America by our police?
lol they gone boycott Nike until the Off Whites drop lmfaoooo
Lol white people and their
Someone please give me another logical reason as to why people are boycotting Nike other than them being racist... Ill be wait.
racists are really burning shoes they already bought like its gonna hurt Nike
s a social issue for Kapernick to talk about, but he wont. He likes grandstanding issues that shift blame to Black Lies Matter and making money from Nike instead. 76% of Black babies born to single mothers. 49% for Hispanics
Imagine a world where white folk boycott an apparel company for their Stand against police brutality and murder. But swoosh in silence when:
Hey racists, Nike already got your money, so instead of burning perfectly good clothes, whynot donate to people who might need them
I wrote this when the "Keurig boycott" nonsense was going around, and I'm reposting in honor of , which is equally stupid. "Congratulations, You're an Idiot"
?? Old butthurt racists are not the key demographic that Nike is targeting.
notice how these guys are only burning outlet store Nikes. Bro, you bought those for $20 3 years ago and wore them everyday without socks, you should DEFINITELY burn them. (also you are racist)
Rahm Emanuel Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Supreme Court I'm black.This is what Dems still to do blacks who flee the plantation.
Burning your Nike shoes? You might be a racist
Yall really burning and cutting up yall clothes thinking its gonna make a dent in Nike Sales, that you already purchased???!!.Ya'll really walking around with baggy socks and holes in shirts. Racism got y'all looking EXTRA DUMB
im laughin at the lmfaooo! you're destroying shoes that you've already purchased???? they already have your moneyyyyyyy!!! sounds about white!
Im gonna need everyone to stop buying Nikes.... That way when them Black Cement 3s launch, Ill be sure to find a pair
nothing at all to do with race...everything to do with being an American!
He still pimpin the boys . White man gettin paid off all that
More upset about a cop killing a person of color (happens once in a while) but not upset about a poc killing another poc( happens prob everyday) shows how fucked up ppl think. U keep killing yourselves daily but cry about some incidents w/cops
We're going to see a plethora of videos of idiots burning their gear. What we won't see is a black man burning his Jordans
I hate standing up for equality too
; Forget ALL of these million dollar / gender / racist / white-people hating...hoping for white genocide Cultists... Take an original stand that helps SOMEONE else ! Imagine that ...unselfishness from the Egoist left...I'm on-board
Instead of donating nike shoes, trumpers are burning em....Nothing more white and Republican than that.Dumbasses
To all the yankee fucktards burning their nikes, is a worldwide brand, your redneck, racist, moronic, conservative ideas have more in common with the middle east than the rest of the world. WE SEE YOU, WE SEE TRUMP, WE ARE SMARTER THAN YOU, NIKE KNOWS THIS.
I haven't owned a pair of 's since i heard they paid children literal slave wages to build their shoes. This only cements why I never will either. I'm a man anyway. Fuck the washout
So sad hes burning those off white prestos
Ive never known Nikes demographic to be angry old racist white men. your ass off guys lol
White privilege is assuming people "less fortunate" don't share similar opinions of the "more fortunate"
White ppl talking about done with  Im over here like Yall dumb as hell Did yall white ppl forget football is yall sport tho
Black Lives Matter. Bob Woodward Kavanaugh Try to follow your own words.
Here's what it really means when people burn their Nikes. There's no room for racists. Call them what they are.
Me showing off my my new Nikes to white People after my shopping spree at the Nike outlet
The latest dog whistle for white folks:
If any of you little white bitches wanna gimme your Nikes instead of burning them Ill take em. Lord knows you dont know how to rock them anyways.
Virgil knowing ain't nobody burning Off-whites.
Believe in something even if it means sacrificing absolutely nothingKaepernick sacrificed nothing. Hes still a privileged, arrogant millionaire.
Easy way to discover the racists
Well, it seems like the racists finally found an N-word they don't love.
Racist America coming out strong with this stupid hashtag.
Let black people live
Sketchers sells out of all-white sneakers.
The question I'd like to ask is why is the Huffington Post always talk about diversity yet your editorial board is all white? don't you practice what you preach?...
Really always been more of a man myself. Are they racist? Plz let me know.
Yo could you ask your fellow racists to help homegirl out
Gee, Trump followers, it's really beginning to look like you don't give two shits about disrespecting the flag....it's all about disrespecting the white man that has you up in arms.
Nike hates white people, If they were to find out Hitler was responsible for the death of over 50 million Europeans. They would change their logo.
The taking any chance to burn stuff that smells of black dignity ? Bitch please. is laughing, Im laughing and the whole world is laughing.
To all the dumbasses doing this i hope all u racist fucks get endless mosquitos bites/ frost bites!
Color me team Under Armour. .
If you're a racist and destroying your Nike stuff for no reason, stop by my place. I'm a size 12!
Aye, I need more to add to my collection, so any racists with size 9 running shoes? Mine are getting clapped. DM for courier details.
? V√≠deos de hillbillies white trash quemado productos y calzado de la marca de la paloma, todo en un intento muy pobre y pat√©tico de mostrarse nacionalistas y sobre todo ofendidos. Realmente nada grave.
Like or Serena or LeBron, elitists arent comfortable with a person of colorbeing himself
1. When will Chicago's black on black murder be addressed by liberals?2. When will RICH, ESTABLISHMENT demorats donate $$ to help Puerto Rico & Flint??
is typical white people throwing a temper tantrum . Nike is still gonna make money so is Colin .
Nothing riles white people up more than a black man having a voice
of course all and are going to blame Trump, white people and anyone else they hate. Hmmm. wouldn't you say? Screw Nike your selling sports gear and pick a guy who can't even get a job in sports to be your "new face" bye bye bye Nike
The people participating in the are the ones who wear white nike crew socks with sperrys.
Dont worry racists. Youll always have your Crocs.
Nike knows black ppl spend way more money on shoes then the others do... when it comes down to it. Its all about money!!!!
Vs. Hello ,Love your work. These are mine. If there are any racist in the DFW area that want to come get these, have at it. They are size 16.Bring some lube, you will need it to remove them when I stick my foot straight up your ass.
So... stop wearing and . Now only people who aren't racist and believe in things like fair treatment and equity and love over hate are wearing Nike. That's a win for their brand.
Imma keep it real with you. Nike doesnt want any racists or bigots wearing their gear in the first place. So if you feel the need to boycott, ask yourself who the problem is.
The stupidity of it all Hahahahah yall are stupid.Boycotting the man who kneeled for police brutality. Has nothing to do with the damn flagAnd this dumb ass set his damn feet on fire.
I already started buying instead of or anyways. for good said every white person. Oh wait till they find out Nike owns Converse now!
The best part of this is seeing all the racists burn inanimate objects as if they have feelings.... Enjoy forking out for your new trainers, losers.
I will be preforming a mass burning of all unworn and/or gently-worn Jordan brand shoes. Please DM me for the address to send your shoes to. Specifically looking to burn a pair of off-white retro 1s in a size 12.
No Im not shaming White people/America so dont even start. But peoples actions show how far they want to associate themselves with the deeds/beliefs of their predecessors. Isnt it ironic by Alanis Morisette Plays in the background...
people stand up for police brutality (via 'patriotism') by burning their Nike stuffread: people reach a whole new level of stupid
quite satisfying seeing racists not only expose themselves but throwing away hundreds of dollars into the bargain....fucking idiots shares drop amid calls for a boycott after Colin Kaepernick deal
America: Home of the racist, land of the cowards
The isnt about respecting the troops or respecting the flag. Its about hating black people and wanting to silence our voices.
We will know the bigots by their charred feet.
omg! Ignore as you have been doing, this is a "hail mary" for them. Their sales have been tanking. They are trying to get people who would not buy their shoes to start buying them again. They are targeting black people. Now that is racist. Kapernick is loser.
the would be better served by all the racist dumbasses not taking their shoes off before setting them ablaze
So Americans are mad that Colin is being represented by Nike. But the thing thats funny is that I see black people or different ethnicities burning Nike clothes but still wearing name brand of someone who dont even want niggas wearing it
Theres plenty other blocks you can cop from that fucks with the slaughter of black people like New balance and under Armour, but I digress
making videos deplorables. Cement yourselves on the wrong side of history. Long after trump, this will circulate around your offices, your kids school, and find its way into your non-racist bosss hands. Keep making videos. Youll pay for your behavior.
Hes basically saying hey wouldnt it be great if the 4th-8th and 14th Amendments were applied to everyone equally? Those amendments are more American than any flag or song.
White ppl are a mess
This really shows you racism is still in effect. Wake up. Also how the media mind controls you to believe the man being represented by the company did something wrong? This is America.
Black people go to all the well know Caucasian spots wearing All White Air Force Ones and knock over all the sparkling water ...that will show them
Don't let Hypocrisy get in the way of your you Faketriots! Nike Go!!
TODAY WAS MY SON'S FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL, AND ALL CHILDREN OF EVERY RACE HAD ON NIKE CLOTHING...
These angry white gonna be pissed when their kids ask for the new LeBrons for Christmas
Colin : Making racists naked again.
Also if anyone's burning their send it my way size 10 shoe L in shirts and other bits my Nike collection can never be too big bunch of racist bellends
think it was great that Jackie Robinson wanted to help black people, but did he hafta do it THAT way?By playing MLB?
The HYPOCRISY is deafening!! Nike & Retards
Those racists and phony patriots lighting their Nikes on fire, please ensure you are still wearing them when you light them up.
Thank you Kap for not only standing up for issues that occur daily in this world but also for exposing all the racist and white privilege in this world!!!
If u plan to be part of this you are racist. No if's, and's, or but's.
Nike has made several things clear:1) They know who/what they want their brand to represent2) They can survive as a brand by alienating an entire demographic3) They don't care if hateful white people accidentally get hurt while destroying expensive athletic gear
Racists are really mad at Nike, huh?! They really DO NOT understand our buying power. Nike when they saw fools burning PURCHASED apparel:
BREAKING - Skoal launches new MAGA flavor chew. It's simple yet brash. Look for it in the all white can.
All the racism in the only makes me wanna buy more Nike.
As a veteran & a person of color, Latino Im done with
Go ahead and expose yourself as a real racist ...
Hey team, somebody buy me some size 10.5 Jordans so I can burn them! The more pairs the better. Get the Jordan 3, 5,10... Really not picky. Bulls colors burn the best, but blue is a close second, so get me those colors. Some running shoes too, and maybe a shirt.
Thank you for keeping the racist out your brand!
Next Nike will be making Pig Soxs and Castro Shirts what a Disgrace !
White boys on Twitter really think burning they shoes go put dent in Nikes profit? SKSKSK this shit hysterical
Again I will ask, what has Kaepernick done for the black communities since he sabotaged his own career? I'll be waiting.
How I feel with a fresh pair of white on whites
Anyone wanna throw their Nike gear out, hmu. I'll coord. the efforts to give your perfectly good shit to anyone, of any race or culture that would kill to have the privilege of owning a piece of clothing w/ that swoosh symbol on it. Youd probs rather burn it tho.
Thank you for showing the world the kkk members with out their mask everyone who's complaining is clearly a racist piece of shit who can suck a dick some are teachers cops your co-workers now you know who they are
from black lives matter's 2015
LOL WHITE AMERICANS ARE THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE
The newest Nike app is likely going to be a generator that automagically transforms your selfie into black and white and randomly selects a quote to overlay center that mimics the campaign. who?
All this time has passed and people still think kneeling during the anthem is about the veterans or the flag. This whole is showing peoples true colours and proving his original point in the first place - racial inequality- even more
Old angry white dudes ain't going anywhere as long as they keep making the Monarch
Sounds about white.
On the flip side, if enough shoe makers hire Kaepernick well be able to identify all the bigots by their lack of shoes.
if anyone doing the has some White Air Force 1 Reflective '07s i can take them off you
man fuck nike, amirite? If anybody is trynna get rid of their air max 97 Off-Whites or sum lmk ill dispose of them correctly
If it wasnt racism, it wouldnt be .. I wont be participating in the .. Sorry..
Nope. Done w/ you., take a knee for your WHITE family who ADOPTED you & treated you like a KING.
White people when troops say they arent offended by anybody kneeling:
Bigots aren't thoughtful? Who knew?
Somewhere Phil Knight is smiling - tennis shoe companys are the KINGS of subliminal advertising. is on everyones mind this morning. Your will only help sales when all is said and done . Nikes target audience (people under 30 of ALL races) will stay loyal.
So many videos of people burning their Nikes today. Why are white racists so obsessed with setting things on fire?
Racist peckerwoods doing what they do best smh when It doesnt fit their agenda they try to destroy it and anyone, organization, or brand included smh
Another installment from the master race
Why are racists burning shoes today?
I have a couple questions about the ) Can white guys wear Jordans?2) That is all.
You tell me white people have so much power over the world we live in that they can boycott a company sending it crashing? Wow
The sheer stupidity of racists
Imagine being so racist you set your own shoes on fire.
Maybe these angry white conservatives will flock to Puma and Adidas now. Their Nazi history goes hand-in-hand with the MAGA crowd.
white ppl get more pathetic each week
If youre racist and you know it, burn your Nike Idiots.
O so corney ass white people aren't gonna be a wearing Nike's anymore? I think Nike knew exactly what they were doing.
I encourage all racist bitches to follow suit
As a single mom of boys, who I need to buy new shoes for all of the time, I'm really ticked off seeing these whiny racists burning perfectly good shoes for no reason other than hate. At least donate them to someone who actually needs them.
You can put a price on an ex NFL football players gear but you cant put a price on devotion, dreams and equality. We live in a world where wanting peace and love is frowned upon, shit hasnt changed since M.L King was shot.
Instead of burning or cutting up perfectly wearable clothes maybe donate them to those in need instead you bourgeoisie pigs. Your childish asses aint cute you look ignorant and privileged.
If any of you white fuckers want to get rid of your Air Yeezy 2s swing ‚Äòem my way.
Hey people please DM before you throw away any shoes so I can send you my address. Send them to me and I will PERSONALLY throw away any Nike shoes you send me in an extra disrespectful way!ESPECIALLY if they are the Off-White collabs in a 10.5 or 11.
is a disgrace! WTH are you thinking? It's like Wheaties putting Edward Snowden on the box! Smh
Slavery is alive and well. Where is the outrage?
These Anglo-saxons are out here with this . over it. We are the largest consumers in America in case you couldn't tell with Black Panther. I'd buy tampons if had his name on it
The black man is looking at the camera. I'm offendedThe words say that being strong willed is good. This is horrible. Who's the snowflake?
good job Nike. You can go down with Kaepernick's career. Colin lives a privileged life while the rest of the working class has to fight everyday for all that we have. I'm not giving you any of my money.
Well done on standing up to the evil of inequality
I love it when things are taken away from racists
Will become the gear of Racists??? learning from other consumer brands $NKE
The shows that Corporate America is dominated by leftists who hate white Republican America and now they are finally making that clear. They can't help it. Which is why I will never get excited over corporate tax cuts. Build the wall. Screw the Ryan corporate agenda.
We have to get screenshots of all these American racists. It'll make a beautiful poster of shame.
All these fat white people burning fresh trainers
All these dumb rich white people burning their nice ass Nikes... like bitch I cant even afford shoes that dont have holes in it lol...
If there is any reincarnation, Trump's next one should be as a lump of white lard.
Im good with the Better chance to actually get the Off-White Collabs
but by all means, boycott a fucking clothing company for hiring a black man
Or boycotting slave labor
If youre participating in the by burning clothes instead of them donating them youre not only a racist, youre a dumbass
If I boycotted Nike for hiring a black man, that would be discrimination and make me a racist so NO Fking Way will I be boycotting Nike!Congratulations
Dear angry white folks: Please consider donating your shoes to the homeless/poor instead of lighting them on fire. People need shoes, man.
Im white and uncomfortable. Therefore ! Lets burn all my Nike shit instead of donating to the veterans in need that I been fake caring about this past year or so. Its my property!
Notice most of these bitches are old fat white guys wearing Dockers and New Balance? Im thinking I need to buy the family matching Nikes.
Knuckle-dragger racist snowflakes burning their shoes they already paid for. Stay stupid, y'all.
WAKE UP WHITE PEOPLE
The Nike boycott is composed of middle aged white men in the south who have owned one pair of Nikes their whole life lmaoooo
Thank god. Perfect timing for all those white bread middle Americans cutting up their gear.
Anyone boycotting Nike and burning any Nike x Off-White please send my way size 10 please!
In fact, is incapable of enacting any genuine act of resistance as they are profiteers that exploit and oppress Black and Brown people (see: sweatshop slave labor). But one ad campaign and a new hashtag has Black folks running to buy more sneakers
Luckily MLK and Rosa Parks did more than cut holes in their socks.
I dont get why people go out of their way to make things worst for themselves, if you care so much give them to someone who needs them its always the wasteful and privileged...
Shoutout to all the racist whites burning gear they already bought, instead of donating them to the homeless veterans they claim to care so much about
I noticed all the pictures of people tearing and burning their Nike items for this are white... coincidence? I think not
Here's how to tell a racist now: they're eating Papa John's and wearing so broke ass Converse or Under Armour. not
Ironic how black people are calling white people out for burning their Nike's but they have no problem burning down their own neighborhoods when they get upset over pretty much anything.
Loool is really trending. Wypypo in disarray cos a major company is standing behind a black man
. This is how children of color feel about White Supremacist vowing to boycott Nike.
The whole 20% of white people (well some of them ) who buy Nikes has me crying with this whole thing Nike will be fineeeeeeee, black people give them the most sales anyway
The only racism is the one coddled by those that want it to be there even where its not. Kaepernick is a fool had millions could have made a difference but would rather insult the very country that gave him success.
Racists: Im never ever buying Nike again :
Trumpian are racist. Im with you Nike.
Sorry to break it to you angry white folks... doesn't care about your bullshit boycott... what makes you think they aren't the ones willing to give up everything to stand for what they believe in?
For all you pressed racist asshats burning your Nike gear ... make sure youre wearing them before lighting. Thanks. - non racist people
If anyone is burning these (not necessarily this colorway) send them to me. I wear a youth 6.5-7 thanks lol
Dear Nike boycotters, Send me all of your off white x Nike collab pieces. I will see that they get proper treatment Thanks,Nathan
I don't see speaking on behalf of the people in Nike sweatshops. Where's their equality? Where's their fairness? But I do see phony ass accepting payment from Nike. Payments made on the backs of 3rd world labor paid dirt wages.
Nike-I believe in equality. I do not believe in disrespecting the flag.
aye any of you dumb racist fucks got them purple Travis Scott 4s in 11.5/12 lemme cop for retail
Ima get me some fresh whites and blacks
Nike got white folks mad as hell today!
White privilege is burning your shoes instead of donating them to homeless veterans.
to all those boycotting....BYE BYE send all donations to your local shelter or is that being racist idk?....ps it truly easier for a camel to walk through an eye of a needle than for a human to get into heaven, keep practicing
You know their Trump shit isnt real when theyre fine with a Gold Star Parent and John McCain being denigrated but are BURNING white Nike shoes and white Nike socks for the veterans.
ia the easy thing for racists. They whine about disrespecting the military. Did Colin Kaepernick put all these homeless vets on the street? Don't think so. 100% racism, nothing to do with respect for military. Which doesnt deserve questionless respect un first place
Nike's "I don't f*ck with you" (in Big Sean's voice) ad campaign has white people in their feelings.
Dear White Folk lol all yall burning your equipment isnt a Lls already has gotten your money you already purchased that item tighten up.
I didnt even know racist people loved Nike so much. Well you guys will have to switch to sketchers/k Swiss.
Tip of the hat to Nike. You got MAGA dipshits to trash your gear and liberals to forget what a fucked up capitalist you are. What, with child labor in sweatshops in 3rd world nations while here in the states faking equality.
Dumb racists are literally setting themselves on fire to protect white supremacy & police brutality on black people!
Pueden soportar eso y m√°s. Lo del son solamente videos de Hillbillies White Trash quemando ropa y calzado deportivo que compraron a plazos, en un pat√©tico intento de mostrarse nacionalistas. Nada grave.
What in the hell did he think was gonna happen??? Racists will literally burn their feet off to protect white supremacy & police brutality on black people!
Where is Jerry Jones and racist crew at?
I wonder if the roles were reversed and it was white people getting brutalized/killed by police, would they finally understand what was kneeling for? WAKE UP!
Theyre calling white people (specially men) racist/ white supremacist for taking a STAND against Nike. So ‚Äòam I (an immigrant) a white supremacist for also taking a stand against NIKE?
I keep reading suggestions that people donate instead of destroy. I love the idea! That's the path to being a more thoughtful bigot
IDPol: If you buy Nike, you're a cuck. But if you criticize Nike, you're a racist. (Third world labour dying in slavery gets ignored.)
If youre participating in the youre racist and thats all there is to it.
. could you please ask why they have zero black Top Execs - Thanks
I'm not an old angry white guy ! shares drop amid backlash over new Kaepernick ad:
From burning crosses to burning Nikes. Those racists love to burn shit
Unsure what to do with my Jordans...I love racial profiling but I REALLY love child labour
When you see a bunch of racist rednecks tweeting about this and how they're going to tank the stock prices of the largest, most recognizable brand in the world, all while being totally unaware the company made $34.35 billion in 2017. Burn your socks, morons.
The Kaepernick and 'ers showing up to the gym and dress down day at work smelling like fresh primer since that deal was announced lol. Take your d6dcf0 eggshell white smellin' ass on LMAO
He should stand for the anthem! Hes disrespect in the troops! Said the racist person who voted for a malignant narcissist, draft-dodging POW-basher.
ahead and please burn your socks. Preferably with your racist little feet still in them.
White people went from burning crosses to burning checks
Adopted & raised by a white couple. Never oppressed once in his fuckin life. Gets injured, comes back, sucks badly, then knowing he's gonna be cut, fuckin kneels then blames cut on . Offered job by then claims blackballing. is a fraud
No one cares about Kaepernick, no one cares about Nike, its a man blaming kneeling for his failures NFL career! Funny how people on Twitter is making it also a racial issue
Y'all will boycott everything but Racism.
All these racists burning Nike gear... its become the new cross in the yard schtick.
From New : pays THEIR slaves pennies per shoe produced & charge you100's via
Nike has ALWAYS had the black vote . This boycott is almost comical . We are the number 1 consumer, therefore Nike sales are about to go through the roof .
If you really have an issue with Nike and Kaepernick, you should donate your clothing to children going back to school who are in need - try and make a difference rather than doubling down on your selfish, racist shitty opinions.
To the left words like "sacrifice" "racist", "nazi", etc mean absolutely nothing anymore. Being a complete idiot is celebrated & rewarded with big money while public discourse is impossible when words lose their meanings. What has this dope ever "sacrificed"?
I cherish our flag. I have pride in our flag, but we are NOT all equal under that flag. Even though we say we are. If you are white, then you may never understand. That's ok, but try, try to understand. That's all I ask.
Searching the hashtag blocking white people who don't realize they're racist.
If you have Nike stuff you no longer want DM me. Ill take it especially if it is an ankle brace.
You know who DIDNT "DO" ANYTHING!? . is trying to capitalize on race. I wouldn't buy a pair of Nikes if they were $0.25 at a garage sale.
In dishonor of yall , heres a pic from my album of me wearing Nikes & a Kaepernick shirt. Get yo money black man
probably one. If not, then my statement about ignorance and racism is correct. (2/2)
What does a dude wearing pig socks and giving money to a cop killer have to do with with black or white?
Can someone tell me how not to offend the American flag? Do I need to have served in the military? Do I need to be Christian? White? Conservative? If I don't tick all boxes What will happen? I'm new to this.
I wear my Nike's proudly! Fuck that hypocritical and racist ass
You dumb racist fucks would rather burn your Nike clothing and shoes instead of donating it or giving them to the homeless veterans you pretend to care about ...
How the hell can you defend this statement? "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color..." His statement is about much more than police brutality and shootings.
If anyone wants to drop off their Nikes, Im a size 13. And I like blue. But will take any colors. Which Ill wear PROUDLY. Yall know where the block button is if need be.
so...let me get this straight... is now the face of international slave labor? 2018 has been a doozy.
Look at how History judges baseball fans who boycotted Major League Baseball after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.None of these people are remembered.Boycott Nike all you want, but the only person who will be remembered by history is Colin Kaepernick!
Does anyone know if Nike makes branded capes?I wanna give 'em to angry, racist MAGA chuds so they can be SUPERMAD.
Every major athletic company either has athletes or people in high positions that don't F with the president or are standing by the only thing racist ppl will be able to wear is fitted bed sheets..wait a min we've seen this attire b4.
Racist white trash burning shoes and themselves, to own the libs!
can you advise me what sports shoes a racist should be wearing now? - asking for a friend.
White people are so destructive. It doesnt hurt the company to burn the stuff you already own.
One of the major problems with the issue is everyone who doesnt agree with the campaign or being characterized as a racist redneck and only old white guys are bothered by it. Yall are gonna guarantee Trump gets re-elected.
LOL, Why didn't the hell people do this in the 90s when slaved kids in Twain was making these shoes in factories?
Nike loves their slave labor over yonder in Bangladesh & Co. With Trumps politics they cant get away with paying kids $1 to make their shoes. Thats where the real beefs at.
I S D U M B .Nevermind that Nike pays slave-labor wages in 3rd world countries.Instead, let's bitch about a guy Nike is paying millions.
Man you guys are fucking babies. Do you really think your boycott matters. You still cant fathom what he was kneeling for. It has nothing to do with the military, and everything to do with equality. You guys are the worst.
The racists are getting absolutely dragged in the Twitterverse over their petty ass , and I'm so here for it.
All the racist have massively called themselves out by burning gear.
Lucky for Nike, their core demographic isnt old angry white guys.
I'm mad at White men so I'm going to burn all my khakis
For those of you burning your Nikes, I wear a women's size 8. I like pink, but I'll take any color.
Why Is¬†Racist
To all the people joining the please send me any pairs of shoes from the OFF-WHITE and Nike collaboration that you have and Id be happy to send you a confederate flag and a pair of tiki torches in return. Im a size 11 btw
Honestly if the goal isn't to make white supremacists boycott everything until they're perpetually naked and hungry hermits what are we even doing
Not to mention that is dumb on its face. Participation demonstrates a lack of understanding of the issue or lack of humanity for your fellow man.
History will remember the men who kneeled at the games much more than the people who freaked out about it. Racial inequality is a real thing, especially when it comes to the law. Wrong side of history dum dums.
Racists testing out other sneakers.
These boycott people cant stand any mention of equality or loss of privilege.They love seeing people of color get mistreated by law enforcement and every other institution in society.Remember these are offspring of the vile racists that ran this country
Seems like a lot of products are burning.....seems like most of this is happening from white people. Im not smart, but correlations are correlations, and I am learning/confirming that a lot of white people are racist.
If you or , you're a racist piece of shit. Where is the logic in this argument. It's filled with more holes than a connect 4 game
Dinesh D'Souza Attacks Colin Kaepernick In Racially Motivated Twitter Rampage
If you think didn't plan to lose money, then you're joking yourself. Your is pointless and racist.
Please do me a favor and check your friends and family for missing Nike labels and swooshes. Their bigotry may have finally eaten through their clothes.
The irony of this is.. most of these white racist are uneducated. they be boycotting Nike but still wear Converse. Nike owns Converse shoes
Qwhite interesting that some Americans are more offended by the new Nike campaign than they are about the number of black lives dying at the hands of the police.
One of the major problems with the issue is everyone who doesnt agree with the campaign or being characterized as a racist redneck and only old white guys are bothered by it. Yall are gonna guarantee Trump gets re-elected.
I only see people burning Nikes from the outlet stores. No one's burning their Kyries, Brons, Jordans or Off Whites. Show me someone burning their Yeezy Infrareds or Air Mags.
White people so privelaged they don't know how to boycott properly. How you destroy what you already bought? THEY GOT YA MONEY FOOL!
Wrong! ....Im not white and I think the flag should respected
Im collecting the cut off pieces Nike clothing and making a quilt of white tears. Lemme know if anyone wants to send any donations...
Angry white people today
why is it that white men arevthe only pressed ones?? Like literally!
forgot about the power of the black dollar
RACISTS IS MAAAD
Anybody who doesnt wear Nike should now be considered racist
Does Nike even make white bed sheets and tiki torches?
Love our schools cafe. Love getting my Big Black Coffee. ∂ŸÑ_ÿ≥ŸÜÿßÿ®_ÿ®ÿ¨ŸàÿßŸÑŸÉ
White Supremacists walking into the Nike store like "Hey can I buy a couple of these shorts and some shoes so I can burn it and feel accomplished."It is literally the dumbest thing ever and I can't stop laughing Colin Kaepernick is winning
Racist whites have been in my job already with the shits
look how long nike been for black people
those who burn their shoes are clueless are siding with with police brutality and racism period
oh and btw you dumbasses , black soldiers who served in the military are also being disrespected when you kneel during the anthem. they fought and died for this country, and you're too fucking ignorant to realize you're also disrespecting black people
This whole racism shit is getting real old
A few hundred bigots have publicly torched their Nike shoes. So brave."Believe in something. Even if it's breathtakingly stupid and means sacrificing some old shoes you were going to throw out anyway."
He can be black all day long... And we can go Adidas, Reebok etc
What's funny is watching all the racism against white people coming out in the wash.
if i saw i would do this in his face. he loves to say "black lives matter" but has nothing to say about the 3, 12, & 14 year old who was shot in Chicago. he don't have the balls to set foot in the slums of that place and give a speech.
In - don't forget Converse, Cole Haan, Hurley International and Jordan Brand!I'd never buy any of these anyway, so maybe NIKE already knows that anti-white racists are their target demographic.
All my white folks wit the lit SNKRS accts lmk wassup mannn
Wear Nikes. Eat at Chic-Fil-A and In-N-Out. Watch Black Panther on Netflix and Bill Maher on HBO. Like every boycott in the past 5 years, the is a sad tale of politics infesting culture at every turn. Now, hold my CHIKN sandwich while I lace up my Air Force Ones!
Wearing all Nike today bc its my favorite and now it apparently pissed off racist white people? ITS A WIN WIN :,)
are all the people apart of the going to admit theyre racist
I am wearing white after Labor Day but not Nike!
Dear Burning them cheap yall burning aint hurting Nike. Yall already paid for em. Jordans run in the 100s and black folk love Jordans! Carry on!
do you really think black people are the biggest consumers in America? Or did you mean they are the biggest Nike consumers? Also Nike runs the 3rd largest sweat shop in the world so my started years ago watch behind the swoosh
It starts small, burning articles of clothing, before moving onto flaming crosses. Thank you Reich Wing bigots and morons for outing yourselves!
Y'all need to go ahead and drop that line and get rid of the rest of the racists that buy your brand
, a racist, but a patriot. I have family and friends you disrespect every time you kneel during the anthem. Also related to a number of law enforcement that are good people. A few bad apples do not make all.
Dear, racistsif you cut the logos of all your gear, its still fucking Nike gear...Its like when you see a Toyota and they took the ota off. It doesnt make it a toy. Its still a Toyota you dipshits.
I want to see somebody burning their Nike Off_White Shoes...
If yall gonna burn some black Air Max's or Huaraches due to , size 10.5, excellent condition, holla at me first
The only thing you believe in dividing the country and sacrificing how beautiful it is!!!! You are a disgraceful!!!!
You people should take a trip to and see how diverse they are at the expense of the white majority in this country. They have deviated fully into the land of SJWs and liberal politics. It is not even remotely difficult for me to boycott.
Over 90% of POC homicides are committed by other POC. Colin Kaepernick was never truly concerned about oppression.
White people burning their only pair of Nike sneakers. Most of you all parents only buy one pair shoes for the whole year. What other pair of shoes do yall have besides some flip flops that has your whole foot imprint on them?.
Won't stand for the National Anthem but will bow down to Nike's $30-$60 million.Colin Kaepernick is a national disgrace and so is
Majority of the shoes I have seen ALL of these WHITE people burning needed 2 b throw the fuck away along time ago anyway they dirty af bent tf up n look stinky if this what it took 4you 2buy a new pair of shoes u should actually thank Nike! But we the dirty 1ns
How is burning your NIKE products you already paid for going to hurt the company....? That white supremacist "logic" has fired your brains.
Hey idiots destroying your stuff - at least have the sense instead to donate it to orgs serving people who don't have the absurd privilege of burning/shredding perfectly good shoes/clothes/sports equipment.
confirms that America is a racist country.I don't live there but as a runner I love .
People are losing their shit over this deal. And I'm over here browsing to buy my new Air Max 270. Red or Black? not
What's that revolting smell wafting up from the south? [Checks Twitter]Ah, it's the scent of racist losers burning their sweaty athletic wear.
Nike aint worried bout you racists...i might actually start wearing it now..
Is that it?So basically are a bunch of racists.Fuck you, racists.
But why white ppl always burn stuff when they get mad?
Hi my fellow white people if we really wanna hurt Nike lets storm there stores and buys out the shelfs and giveaway the shoes to the poor and vets great ideas huh?
Lets check Twitter.Bunch of racists burn their Nike clothing.Actually, Im good.
The Tiki torch dudes marched while yelling we will not be replaced. The Nike burners are comparing photos of a white hero who would have been a better symbol of sacrifice. Some white MEN feel like an endangered species and they are now hypnotized with hatred
Me noticing the top posts are actually (mostly) white people condemning racist and standing up for Kap.
Short Sleeve Black Fashion DressesLink - ...Kavanaugh Senate Judiciary Committee Henry Cavill Kamala Harris Bryan Antoine
All I see is cleats, a few pair of socks and a pair of shoes being burned, wheres the rest of it yall racist peasants claim to have
I'm proud of him for the simple fact that he took a stand for his convictions. Despite the willful misinterpretation of his message, career blackballing, and violent threats, he hasn't backed down.
White American Men always seem to resort to fire and burming, be it "witches" crosses or trainers.
White Rage and ignorance are the only things fueling the
Chevrolet Signed Colin To An Ad Deal Also .....Are You Racist Rednecks Burning Yall Trucks ?
The abject failures known as white supremacists are the real
Well said .......... only in America can you disrespect our Flag and service men and women and get paid millions. YOU are a disgrace and so is Nike.
I completely agree with this boycott. Which is why what yall white people should do is send your nike products to me. Ill take care of them for you.
The racists don't get it --on purpose
I didn't know white twitter was a thing until I saw trending.
I stand with and you racists folks will NEVER WIN!
i'm interested in knowing, besides race, why are you ok with police not being held responsible when they kill unarmed citizens or those carrying in an open carry state that are complying, and planting guns/drugs to validate arrest/murder?
Is there a white man who happens to have a sneaker endorsement deal? Can't think of any. .
....Good!....I don't want racist idiots wearing Nike anyway....go buy those ugly ass Yeezy's...
I'm cool with the racists and Trumpalos boycotting shoe and apparel brands until their only clothing option is burlap.
Any of you white supremacist getting rid of your shoes wear a size 8 in mens? I'll take your Js off of you.
Why are racists burning their Nikes when itd be 1000% more efficient to mail them to me
Only people Is Dumbass white people pure ignorance
Dear white people, black people are the number 1 consumers in America. You are not hurting Nike.
Them racist whites at it again with the donate yo shit to goodwill so I can dress nice for the fall
I'll be wearing my Nikes today, while the racist have their adorable little . P.S The execs are LAUGHING THEIR ASSES OFF at all of the butthurt snowflakes setting Nike apparel on FIRE AFTER they BOUGHT it!
so you mad with Nike but not mad about the police brutality. Ppl getting beaten and killed by the ones who are supposed to protect. You remain silent on that but you mad at Nike? Ok
I swear, white people be quick to boycott anything other than racism.
Cant wait to wear a full Nike outfit head to toe today to make some old white men mad
Another fun thing about this boycott. Reporting all of the racist tweets.
Maybe Nike did this on purpose. Maybe they got tired of old ass white people buying their shoes and always giving people a thumbs up.
White tears everywhere
hopefully means ill be able to win shoe drawings on sneakers app now white people doing me a favor with this one
WHITE PEOPLE ARE PISSED
Talk about inequality. Tell this to the sweatshop employees that make Nike shoes.
I challenge EVERY white person to listen and understand why Kaepernick decides to kneel. Please. If you think hes trying to disrespect the flag/veterans/current soldiers you are simply wrong and you arent listening. You are the problem, not him.
Hey, racists dickheads, it doesnt count if you bought your tennis at Goodwill
Every major shoe company is endorsed by black athletes and black artists. Point black period! If Crocs want to sponsor Alabama dammit we can play. But I promise you it won't go good.
Does this mean well see less white boys wearing Nike elite socks
Public service announcement for racist Wypipo...
This is an example of racism. The belief that one race is superior to another race.
Racist I'm never buying AGAIN!!
Yall really out here burning ya Nikes? Yall REALLY for hate black people have anything
You dont see how Racist your tweet is!
No one cares about you racist turds and the . This is not about veterans or athletes disrespecting them. You know why they kneel and the fact that people are boycotting speaks volumes. Take those $$ and spend them on a veteran if you care that much.
Im a VETERAN. I am a WOMAN. I am BLACK and I am American. This flag doesnt represent me, even though I bled for this country. I will buy MORE Nike.
When will people understand that kneeling doesnt equal disrespecting the flag ...
Be proud ! The fact that you're trending with is a special honor: you're standing against & in a time where hatred & dumb-supremacy are trying to infect people's is with you!
Burning clothes is basically modern day smoke signals to confirm your position as a racist.
Hmmm, seems about WHITE, yall want to destroy any hopes of equality in this country. All this man did was SHOW AND PROVE that racism & POLICE BRUTALITY STILL exists! & by doing this only proves his point more. But it aint happening to yall so why do yall care?
Anyone who participates in the is most likely racist.
I will never wear your garbage again!! To have someone like that be your face is disgraceful!! To disgrace our nation and flag youve never been handed a folded flag!! Nike sucks!
To all the salty racists participating in the and burning their gear: Nike already has your money. You're a special kind of stupid.
Don't worry, bloated old racists! These'll look great with your UnderArmour track pants and yellowed MAGA T-shirt.
Hey guys, you know what Kaepernick hates more than the flag? Poor/underprivileged people. Especially kids. Oh man does he hate well fed and clothed kids! Show him what you really think of him! Get out there flag warriors and feed and clothe all the kids!!!
After racist rednecks are done with no one is going to recognize the Nike check symbol. Lol
over price crap that half the people who buy it can't afford it in the first place. The people who make it are basically being paid slave wages where is Nike's social conscience.
Looks like is finally giving racists something to burn other than tiki torches and crosses.
Yall racists still mad?
Yall racist fools dont get tired of having hate in your heart for People of Color?
White ppl love "boycotting" shit they've already paid for. "I'm going to buy a coffee and tell Starbucks my name is Merry Christmas!" ...ok? "I'm going to throw away these Nike shoes I've already bought!" ...ok? They already got your money... but... ok.
this is the crazyest thing I have ever seen. The only people upset are studid white people
Oh yall Racist Racist
How about instead of burning your Nike gear, go and stop being ok with police killing unarmed black people
When the fools and racist who don't realize Nike makes the NFL jerseys they want to wear.......
Nike trolling with their own kind of racist dog whistle. We're all waiting for you too! Follow Nike's example and let's put the spotlight on people that can't stand someone bringing attention to marginalization.
India & America Democracies have a LOT OF Similarities !!!In INDIA , Nationalists Boycott Actors & Amazon !!!In America , White Nationalists Do a !!!
How can you tell where a racist lives?Scorch marks in the grass, burnt Nike gear and broken Keurig machines spread across the lawnYeah, sure that will hurt a company who makes 34 BILLION a year
man y'all racist fucks big mad. Y'all not mad at the unpatriotic president y'all elected, though?
Hey old angry white guys - you're not 's demographic in the first place. Enjoy boycotting a company that already thinks you're irrelevant.
Yall stop arguing with these racist fools. Let them be stuck.
Black ppl... I know were ready to buy all the Nikes buyable... but please do not buy Jordan heels... theyre still inappropriate.
White people burning their Nike gear but i bet none of yall gon sell yo stock
If any of you so-called racist Nike boycotters wear size 11 in Womens, Ill DM you my address to take it off your hands.
HEY any white folks got some SEAN WOOTHERSPOON'S they tryna light on fire, asking for a friend. you people are so dumb, and I do mean you people lol
Those slave kids sure know how to make sneakers.
White people love setting shit on fire that they paid for
Nike Board Meeting: "We're worried too many nazis, white supremacists, and ignorant dip shits are wearing our products. How can we change this?"Ad Exec: "Hear me out..."
I'm not destroying anything I've bought.. Besides many groups feel privileged and above other groups.
All the coolest white supremacists are switching from crosses to sneakers. Tell a friend.
Ignorance has no color
Man if yall dont want your nikes anymore, SELL THEM. These white people wasting too much money cutting up their shoes to try to make a point
LOVE LOVE LOVE NIKE Yes! thank you! Angry ignorant old white people dont wear Nikes I will kneel with
Old racist white men haven't been their core demographic or sales source in decades. isn't afraid lol
YOU CANT HIDE YOUR RACISM WITH PATRIOTISM .......
I thought would be about the exploitation of workers in third world countries. Clicked. Turns out, nope. American racists prevail again under the Republican-Trump America.
If the biracial quarterback with an African father and a Jewish mother could play, he would have been signed somewhere years ago...
Careful America your racist is showing
Looking at this and yall racist RACIST
I preferred when it was over their sweatshops and labor practices, not seeing and hearing black athletes.
Nike is a 30 + Billion dollar company. These redneck's wanting to boycott Nike don't own a pair of shoes. Kneel on that you bunch of racist conservatives.
I wonder if all the idiots burning their Nikes (instead of donating them to the Veterans they "care" about) for the realize that 40 year old White dudes living in their parent's basement are not the target audience for Nike?
About showing respect for the Military. It was about the people who he thought was beneath him. If he truly respected our Military he would never have said what he did about McCain &the Gold Star Family, regardless of their political beliefs, race, religion or sex.
Or, and stay with me for a second...We value the lives of those who died for those songs and flags to give EVERYONE those privileges. WOW! Thats unheard of
More and more we need to vote with our dollars as more and more CEO's are revealing their true colors.
LMAAOOOOOOO yall really on this mess like going anywhere. wheeeeeeeww the racists came to play today
White folks are dumb as hell
If anybody doesnt want their nikes yall can send them to me lol Ill take some off white ones preferably foams , Lebrons, KDs
Me watching White supremacists & Conservatives burning their shoes & clothes:
If youre walking around barefoot drinking Nescaf√© , you might be a racist.
I'm pretty sure you've never attended a Black Mans funeral brutally murdered by Police Officers and witnessed the crying of his Mama, Wife and children. GTFOH Racist !!
If one realizes that the average Nike boycotter is a 65 year old white guy wearing $9 dollar Walmart velcro walkers, one understands why Nike isn't overly concerned with the boycott.
A REMF is patriotic AF and respects the flag in unhealthy ways.A grunt will clean up with a flag after beating off on midnight radio watch in an AAV turret. He fights for himself and his friends--even the black ones.
If yall cared half as much about the victims of police brutality as you would about your stupid ass ... wouldnt have to kneel.
Anyone else notice waited until after back to school shopping was done to announce this? They wanted everyone's money before they pandered to blacks?
Im not old or white and Im down with the
Haven't been really paying attention to all this Nike/Kaepernak stuff. But I do have a Q.Has Tiger Woods weighed in yet with his typical weak-kneed anti-black nothing burger of a statement cuz he be rockin Nike hardcore every time he steps on a golf course.
Look at all the drooling over one of the biggest evil capitalist companies out there! Careful, your hypocrisy is showing.
Looks like is sacrificing their stock price and their sales revenue for what they believe.Great job siding with racist cop hating bigots!The and gon b lit!Happiest people today: execs and shareholders.
The racism is jumping out & I love it! I like my racists to be out & open about it! Dont leave me guessing if youre a piece of shit or not!
is fighting oppression!
Racist Bama, Ohio St, Clemson, TCU, etc, fans what yall gonna do with they team apparel
Makes a good point. It is time we finally allow black people to play football.
"Old angry white guys is not the core demographic for Nike products." Except old angry white guys is the demographic that has the money to buy Nike products.
I wish I would boycott an American brand like and I'm a combat veteran. We really lost it and the way yall go about oppression is really beneath my nikes
ATTN: ALL IGNORANT WHITE PPL... If ur gonna burn things please do it while wearing them...It helps when u play the ignorant card to the fullest...Makes for a more believable story
You could have donated your Nikes to Homeless Vets instead of cutting them up or setting them on fire. but hey, way to show privilege by being able to throw out clothing and shoes like it's nothing.
Tangier Nike outlets got that 3 for 25... any colors you want...
The other race is something else smh thats all I have to say about the oh and Congrats Kap! Well deserved
This talk of a by conservatives who don't like Kaepernick's deal w/ Nike is further confirmation that humanity is doomed. Either they are sheep who believe the bigots trying to mask the police brutality issue or they are the bigots themselves.
You know your living a "privileged" life when you can literally set shit you own on fire that others can't afford
The hypocrisy of shoe burning in this country has reached epic levels.
YES!!! But we know this - only hate-filled racist are opposed to won't happen in my family. Love you more now!
If you purchased a product, you surely knew they sponsored black athletes. Now is fronting their 30th anniversary and now youre burning your trainers. Racist are really bizarre people.
Dear Racists,Instead of throwing your Nike away, why dont you dontate them to the homeless veterans you pretend to care about?
Racist: we are never buying another pair of nikes again Nike:
Not sure why a bunch of white people are destroying their athletic apparel as part of a when Adidas and Puma, two companies founded by actual Nazis, are more than happy to take their money instead.
Its funny seeing white people mad at a black man stay mad
. have sold there souls and are nothing more than anti-America anti-white racists, Ill never touch any of there products again!
Seems turning down job offers and then blaming racism for not having a job is all it takes to impress the liberal goons at Nike!
You are a race bating scum bag. Your kind (Marxists) are LOSING in every aspect. WE ARE TAKING THE COUNTY BACK LOSER! The RED WAVE is coming, and when it does your kind will politically , culturally and spiritually drown.
White Supremacist burning Nike gear? those thugs are something else
'm still stunned sometimes that a group of the most privileged and richest people are threatened by a guy kneeling respectfully. And they resolutely lie about why he was doing so.
that isnt how this works so allow me to enlighten you! A swath of people Left of center capitulate to ideas of false narratives, false equivalencies, fake rage, fascism, racism and other childish behavior
Nike don't want you bitch ass mayo flavored racists anyways fuckin clowns.
Never mind a after the middle finger to the orange bigot, I think I'm more likely to purchase my first ever pair.
love how people think writing marine or military means that their opinion carries more weight, so what if you have shot people in Iraq! If you are more worried about people kneeling than cops murdering people you are a bigot and a fool
: *makes the face of their brand* Racists:
I think we need to remember the Red, White and Blue is not the rebel flag symbolizing a heritage of Hate. The is very dear to some people. It symbolizes , how ever you feel about America will determine your side of this debate.
: *makes the face of their brand* Racists:
So sweatshops and child labor weren't enough for some to participate in a , but Nike highlighting a man standing up against racism and police brutality will make them burn their gear? Neat.
If you paid money for a product, and then burn said product bc youre a racist clueless idiot, the transaction has already been completed numbskull, you still gave them your money, youve accomplished nothing lmfaoooooooo
Why do white people always start burning shit, you could donate it to people in need.
Have fun watching all of your favorite NFL players wear Nike gear through 2028, racists.
A favorite response of the GOPers I hear from is "WHAT ABOUT ..?" So , What About Unarmed Black Teens Being Shot in the Back ? It's what the kneeling was about .
Racist white people LOVE burning things, apparently.
is smart. All these white boys are gonna burn their shoes and then theyll realize they dont have any shoes left and their mom/dad is gonna go out and buy them new ones.
Why is a grown man wearing white athletic socks to work?
How many black ppl burned the clothes they already purchased from H&M during "Coolest Monkey gate"??? I'll wait...
I've been wearing Nike since the early 80s. "Nike Cortez" racists want to I do not stand with bigotry, hatred, khaki shorts and tiki torches.
I've been to races when uncle Sam's chose people who would N E V E R disrespect the anthem or flag have gotten up for a smoke break, bathroom or nachos during it
yall burning clothes yall already bought. Nike isnt gonna give you a refund, and if youre boycotting also knows youre racist now too so I doubt they care about losing a bigot for a consumer.
These racist Miracle Whip MAGA Margarets really think cutting THESE up is really doing something. That money BEEN got.
When ur So in favor of blacks being killed, you burn your sneakers!
you guys are disgrace to the country for entertaining anti-American so wrong...
White people are sooooo triggered and they have no idea why
damn i wish Kaepernick signed a deal with Sketchers or New Balance..racist ass mfs wouldntve burned them shits i bet
Attention all racist republicans.
should honor real heros and not racists like . is allowing this hate and racism.
These racist ass Rather have a Swastika then a Swoosh
So uhm...anyone on the ...can I have your shoes? I don't have enough, especially not enough that aren't black. I have men's 10,5-12. depending on the fit, rather 12 to be on the safer side. Thanks guys.
white ppl mad lol
country hated MLK, Malcolm X , Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali too(Some still do) . This is what happens when you speak out against oppression and institutionalized racism. It's more palatable to attack the oppressed than to face the truth.
For the bigots who are doing a and hiding their racism behind fake patriotism...
would be cool if and could also sign to market their brands. , update the contract to make this happen. Racists should be forced to only wear crocs.
Colin kneeling isn't saying fuck America or disrespecting veterans, it's not about disrespect,it's about spreading a message of unsatisfactory with how people are being treated in this country,& how this country has failed enforcing that all men are created equally
Anyone doing this shit is a moron piece of shit and deserves to burn their own asses down !! Racists assholes !!
Imagine being so openly ignorant and racist that you'll burn sneakers and pretend does anything other than out you as an asshole?
I will be wearing these today while they out here talking about a Untold Truth Collection. Memphis Red Sox. Learn some Black History
Yall white people annoying
"iM boYcoTTiNG niKe" okay well I'm a women's 7.5 so if you have any of those sneakers that are real cute and not too big & bulky bc I certainly don't need them for ~athletics~ then send them to me thanks dumb white ppl!
I see all the racists are trying to boycott Nike now. So Im gonna wear all Nike today
Well, it'll be easy to guess who the white male in New Balance sneakers carrying a box of Papa Johns pizza is voting for at the polls...
This could be terrible for the company if they continue to lose the valued inactive racist market.
Screw the . If I had the money I'd buy one in every color.
After all the racist sell there Nike stocks and burn the gear . Im gonna come through with all my new Nike attire like:
Dear and ,Nothing exposes reactionary ignorance like a good ole, self defeating, counter productive , and for this we thank you! Humanity
Thankfully, angry white dudes not a core demographic for Nike. Cheers.
These white folks real life mad
So y'all burning clothes y'all could be donating to veterans or the homeless or pretty much ANYONE in need ...This is some Fake Patriotic White privilege Bullshit
by these racist & white supremacist is a deflection from the main issue(s) of systematic & institutionalized racism & white supremacy. Never about the flag(although the national anthem has racist origins).
White supremacists are burning their
might as well make a shirt that says no KKK here! I know racist white folks, don't know where to go! They are already in hell, trying to make this planet hell! But in the end, they only hurt themselves with their hate!
Nike makes billions of dollars all over the world you cant burn that or tear it Black POWER
What about the hypocrisy of standing for black lives but not caring for the lives of the actual slaves that make the product you're putting your face on?
Yeah, Pat Tillman! Except for the fact that black men are murdered daily by "friendly" fire, as well.
This guy is racist trash. Throw his out twitter
Nike SIDING with RACISM and brutality against police?Their Leftist crazy robes are showingWe dont need their stinking sneakers
Ill be buying 2 pair of this week. Thx for standing up to police brutality as bigots.
White ppl getting rid of Nike's like ...
Kaepernick - Not to mention knows their brand has been built off the selling the image of Black athletes who everyone wants to be like.
Why can white people do this to the flag & it's not "desecration" or "unpatriotic," but others can't kneel in its presence to bring attention to the disconnect betw the ideal it represents & their experience?
The hypocrisy with the y'all mad about Kaepernick, but were y'all this mad when news broke about child labor making these shoes? Slide in my DM if you're trying to burn your shit, I'll happily take them
If you lowkey racist and have womens Vapor Maxs in size 9, hmu.
When peaceful demonstrations don't work, riots ensue. Where do you want to fall in the history books? The screaming white mean girl behind the black girl going to a white school? will be the Rosa Parks of our time.
I couldn't wait to wake up to see what you racist motherfuckers were tweeting about . you
I remember shopping at Florsheim Shoes for dress shoes when I was a kid. That seems to be a good place for old white dudes onboard with the to go.
White snowflakes going crazy. Are they gonna wear s sneakers now.
To be fair, Nike doesn't make white hood and robes, so...
This is how you know that RACISM is a severe illness
$3 billion lost by in the first hour of trading. Don't be surprised if they bend the knee. The left will then scream "racist!" and they will then lose even more market share. They dug themselves this hole. They get to lay in it.
I want to point outNew Yorker was going to have Steve Bannonheadline a festival until the outcryThey did not think THAT outThat saidthe is by redneck racistswho can't afford Nike shoes anywayThey got all their money tied up ininvestments in taint wipes.
Lmaooooo....Whew Chile The Racism
Watch out for those who advocate a but say nothing about police brutality. Thank You & for standing for something
"Honey, look behind my box of Sketchers & see if you see any of my Nike shoes that them color folks be wearing... no, not my thong flops! The ones with a check on it"
Coming on Twitter this morning only to see reactionary racists with their like:
Its been explained for over a year now how Kaepernicks kneeling had absolutely zero to do with The National Anthem or the flag, yet Conservatives are citing it as their reason to burn their Nike goods. Its undeniably a race thing at this point, such fools.
I guess are done trashing a former POW during his funeral and are now back to pretending it's black people who are the unpatriotic ones.
Wonder which company is looking to capture the racist market. Huuuuuge potential, lolz.
All the racist white people who want to should spend their money on bullet proof backpacks or inserts for their kids this school year. I don't watch the I don't own .Ijs everyone who is angry about is entertaining the wrong shit.
So you're part of the conspiracy theory of institutionalized racism while denying the facts that disprove it? like you are why it will always be obscure and I have never fully committed myself to it.
Kaepernick took a great stand for humanity and there are plenty more reasons we should all take a knee. We have 99 problems and Kaepernick ain't one.
This is the most racist shit, and the sad part is the majority of the folks participating have no idea what they're actually standing against .I blame the media, yalls president, and america's lack of information.Yall are shameful
This sounds about WHITE
Supreme Court ended Slavery till tried to pay
This whole thing is the pinnacle of stupidity. You are gonna harm Nike by burning your Nikes? Lol. People need to remember Kaepernick kneeling was always about police brutality to people of colour, and it was a VETERAN that said he should kneel originally...
White Americans Are Having Truly Black American Moments.....A Hip-Hop Beef and Boycott All In 5 Days.......Sheeeesh
Reebok and Adidas need to get behind this so we can identify racist by their lack of tennis shoes .
was respecting the flag & also the millions of lives that have been lost as a result of racist and discriminatory legislation for hundreds of years. if you want but never forget about creating an even playing field.RIP White America 1492-2016
Im not racist but...Liar liar feet on fire.
When white people are upset that mean shit is getting done. good for kap. Im going to buy some soon
Black ppl are loveliest, warmest, most giving people in the world
Sure they're manufactured by slaves, but whatever.
Amazing how many blatant Racists have appeared regarding the
Racists have started
Go search you will see white devils that eat papa Johns with enjoyment while raising future domestic terrorist
white racists.... F**K YOU
So many "White People" are acting like a 1 yr old child and burning their nike items. "STUPID"
Copped these yesterday before s endorsement of Brother Kap; rocking them today. Quite the coincidence. all of you butthurt, racist, fake patriots
60,000 slaves in America today. 125,000 babies are aborted in America every day. 2.5 million children are homeless in America today. I have neither the time, nor inclination, to care about .
Instead of worrying about , turn on whats happening to our democracy in on capital hill. Crazy old white men are destroying the country. shouldn't be allowed to chair anything. Incompetent asshole.
HEY WHITE PEOPLE! NEED TO BURN UR NIKE ITEMS? SEND TO ME INSTEAD. SHIRTS: SIZE WOMENS L MENS SM SHOES: SIZE 7.5 UR WELCOME
Its too early in the morning for racists to be this dumb go back to bed and chill
This farce has never been mistreated by a cop in his life. Adopted by a rich white family, pampered due to his ability to play football, and now given millions for being. Fake bc he is no lonelget good at football
I guess liberals are back to pretending black people dont kill black people but cops do!
He did a lot of trashing too, being a POW has nothing to do with it. Its like saying your black. I am sorry your a libtard.
African American Veterans were denied benefits and also lynched. White people NEVER honored the flag. I LOVE YOU NIKE & COLIN KAEPERNICK, I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BUY SOME SHOES AND WORK OUT GEAR
This is a prime example of white privilege. Literally burning a pair of shoes that could have been donated to a Veteran in need and then claiming its in the name of patriotism is the definition of hypocrisy and ignorance.
regardless of his skin color, is a weak QB and he has no place in as a starter. Stop politicizing sports specially
This is what white racists are doing...
Sadly racist white people don't buy Jordans, so you're still not getting the ones you want on the next drop!
There are a ton of cops in this nation who act like pigs. Perhaps pig socks were a shot to those types of officers. is about nothing but racist, butthurt people. You don't fool anybody.
Ain't no nigga cutting up his jordans. That's some privileged wypipo shit
I wish old racist/ problematic white folks would channel this energy to helping the homeless veterans they claim to care about
Along with their , the Deplorables apparently already had a toilet paper and toothpaste boycott going for years, although I think it's unrelated to their racism.
had a boot jerking off so much in a guard tower he turned a green sandbag white
Suck a dick u republican bitch RT : I will never buy another item from again. What a disgrace.
Dear white racists, your little tantrum will do nothing. White racist Americans are not the only ones who buy Nike. The WORLD and black people love em! Go ahead and burn it Colonizers.
Those who wish to simply dont get it. Theyre blinded by their racist views and clearly have no understanding of what its like to be a person of color in this country.
White people love setting shit on fire
I Will Trace Your Logo Jpg Png Image Within 2 Hours. Contact me ™Ÿä_ÿ™ÿ™ÿÆÿ±ÿ¨
WHITE RACISTS are mad. Oh well. We stand with you
everyone saying theyre going to boycott lmaoooo you are a drop in the bucket to them and ALSO, it shows how bigoted some people really are
So who are the real snowflakes now? The NFL or all the salty white people destroying merchandise they already paid for?
is a disgrace. Will never buy anything from them.
Lmao y'all crazy and racist. And that's facts.
*insert the whites are at it again meme*
In this hashtag you will see how librals mind work and evolve : stage 1 - Make fun of those who are going to boycottstage 2 - starting to through white privilge card stage 3 - through the racist card stage 4 - attacking the accounts of those who will boycott
Ways to spot racists in America:Pre MAGAts:White hoodsShaved headsSwastikas on clothing Post MAGAts:Red hatsKhakisAthletic apparel with big ass holes cut out of them.
The whites are upset today
Go ahead, burn your Nikes. Then go out and buy white person supremacy shoes from .
Anyone boycotting Nike is displaying their racism for all to see.
These tweets related to this hashtag are troubling. Racism is alive and well. More people should leave their nest when they are young. Break the cycle from rest of your family. Embark on a quest to experience culture. Live in the most cities in your lifetime.
Youre a racist like
Democrats are an National disgrace! Kavanaugh
It's nice finding out who all the racists are with this, but are there still a lot of sweatshops too?
Awwwe white racists are having a tantrum. COLONIZERS.
*niggas really mad blacks lives matter
At Nike HQExec 1: How do we prevent bigots from wearing our shoes? Exec 2: What if we hire for the 30th Anniversary campaign? Exec 1: Perfect!!!
Do my 5 year old daughters shoes make you check your racism at the door? Awesome
Attention bigots....
BLACK PPL !!!! CONTINUE TO BUY NIKE AND BUY THESE WHITE MENS STOCKS THAT THEY ARE SELLING
For the easily offended white supremacists, donate your Nike gear to homeless vets. Since you're all about vets, except McCain. Or Phil Knight, co-founder of Nike.
When you hate black people so much you burn your sneakers.
Does Nike know blacks are only 13% of the population? Seems like a bad PR move.
will they ever get it, racists
How do I get out of Black twitter to see all the white people burning Nikes?
Imagine being so angry at seeing a black man get paid that you destroy your $200 pair of sneakers.
So apparently my tweets calling racists stupid for burning their clothing in a misguided attempt of patriotism were a bit too harsh and have been removedI guess racists dont have thick skins, hope you didnt burn all your Nike tops
All these Nazis & fascists freaking out over standing by has made my entire morning. Even my tea tastes better. Suck it police state loving, boot-licking racist trash!
Nike is international a few American racist cant change the reputation of their brand.
The most racist people all over America.... are burning their Nikes.
What kind of country produces people who think that believing and being anti-racist=being anti-American?
is basically white people burning down the good they already own.
I'm sure Nike is happy that white supremacists will no longer be buying their merchandise. They can keep their money.
Fuck the movement all dem white boys still gon flex them roshe runs foh
All those people burning their shoes are all white trash.
The only people offended by the ad are the racists. Nike has been doing type of thing this for years.
Dont worry Nike, Im gathering some ppl.Im going to buy some stock today. Hollywood will too. We wont let people pretend this is about patriotism. They need to care about all races. No one deserves police brutality. Its not prejudice to correct a bad policemen.
Hey Racists Idiots: Once again, burning something you already PAID Nike for, is not a BOYCOTT! - Zero gain. We get it, numbers are hard for you guys, thats why you put the country in the red every time you take over.
Them: iM nEveR buYiNg aNytHinG NikE aGaiN NIKE DOESNT NEED WHITE RACIST CONSUMERS ANYWAY YALL ARE BURNING THOSE WHACK ASS MONARCHS, RUNNING SHOES & SOCKS... GET A GRIP
I want all racist hillbillies to , that's not the image they were looking for anyway.
This is how white people will be since they burned their shoes.
White supremacist when they find out what they get to put on fire next
If anyone wants to burn some Off white x Nike please hit me up 1st. Ill buy them
Why are you white people ripping something you already purchased? Idiots. Your COLONIZING anthem is not for people of color. DEVILS.
How much clout would I get if I burned my Off-white vapormaxes and post the video on twitter?
The racist really jumping out in that hashtag
Soy yo o el mundo anda on fire √∫ltimamente lets end racism
don't see a reason for me to boycott Nike.... They are standing up against racism and my black people aren't saying nothing, so I will sit my ass down.
Racists burning their Nike stuff...do they know Nike still got their money though ? Hahaha
The racists are big mad
The is what happens when white supremacy doesn't work like its supposed to. Its supposed to take everything from you when you assert your humanity. This is to teach you and others around you a lesson. When instead you continue to thrive, that's when the rage kicks in
Racists really love lighting shit on fire: first crosses, now Nikes
please keep and RT sometimes a visual can help bigots see
Make a officer and see how fast that privileged dainty effeminate jackass runs and hides.'s are gay. Anyone caught wearing them after today likes it up the ass.
WHITE DEVILS are so emotional. COLONIZERS.
These at the closeted racists doing a . Hahahahahaha
I don't think a led by white supremacistswill be very effective.Nike doesn't make camo, bib overalls do they?
Here is something for you white supremacists fake ass Patriots.
Yall white folks mad as hell aint it?
I never would have expected a company of this magnitude to actually take a stand in racial politics. I applaud Nike. Explain I'm glad people are actually trying to stand for what they "believe in", but what exactly is it that you are standing for?
Look how angry these racist white people are in 2018 lol. There is no law stating we have to stand for the flag. They actually want a dictatorship lol
S/O to and for this expos√® on Racism via the
Anyone who wears white athletic socks of any brand deserves to see them burn
The ugly head of racism shows itself again!
Was on the fence about those joggers this weekend. This snowflake is heading back to buy them in every color today. is so unnecessary.
White boys cutting the swoosh off socks they've already paid for and calling it a boycott
Look closely at this picture...Now guess why dgaf about all the redneck bigots and their
So uhm, I'll gladly take some of that Nike gear off your hands (especially any Off-White/ Travs/Reacts/Classic SBs)
The real loser in the is . Since Adidas, Puma, and Reebok are all German-owned, the white-supremacists will once again be looking to you to pair with their khakis.
Dear folks, instead of boycotting Nike, why dont you boycott white supremacy, confederate monuments or police brutality. Better ways to make the country great. Signed Your Future
Lmao white people wild
White people love burning stuff ...
And what does this have to do with race,is this the fall back for every thing?
reading all this still shows how racist we are as Americans.. pretty sad
Dear , please put Kaepernick's face on your cups so we can see white folk lose their minds choosing between "patriotism" & a pumpkin spice latte.
Say NO to . Again, seems America listens to Trump and not the players. Kaepernick started the knee movement to bring awareness to police brutality of black men - not a snub to our flag or the military.
do know that you fools who boycott over but not Trump over racism speaks volumes.
.....I wouldn't watch "Kaep" play a kids game regardless of any perceived privileged you want to blame but whatever makes you feel better
Wow! People would rather stand for this than Racism, Mass Incarceration, Gun Violence, etc.
Racists, and a few demented acolytes, are having a temper tantrum bcse a very powerful company with logos they have in their homes and see all over has endorsed a man they tried to punish for insulting white supremacy. Don't offer them sympathy or they won't learn.
Lol, there is no . You really think Nike wasn't already writing off you mouthbreathing racists/"patriots" before they made this move. This move was telling you to fuck off, so what's a boycott do?
: when you're *still* pissed off there was a black president
Rather than continue to burn the shoes and clothes, how about you donate them to the homeless veterans you're attempting to hide your racism under?Funny how you all want to have a and forget that also exists.
WTFCan one leader tweet themselves going to a homeless shelter & disposing of those horrible socks/shoes so someone less fortunate & privileged enough to destroy perfectly good clothing can wear them? I promise, they wont care they have swooshes
The is stupid and done by the kind of people who are ok with Conservatives groups calling gays "fags" but when black people don't say slavery was the best thing that ever happened to them they are traitors.
If anybody who is boycotting has some all black or black and white huaraches you can go head and slide them my way instead of burning them
is a joke and ya'll racism showing
Yall are racist assholes if youre doing this....its great to be exposed isnt it?... is the dumbest thing
The flag represents the self-evident truth that all men are created equal. When our fellow countryman behave in ways that disrespect those truths, the most respectful thing you can do is ask for better.
dont worry, people in white America have been brainwashed to believe their culture is innately good... it never was
The Good Out Weights The Bad!!!! Do what's good for humanity!!! Stop wasting valuable clothes and keep in mind that your fellow Americans need you.....
are a racist for not buying or burning the merchandise.No I dont see a sacrifice in this
RT eugenegu "White supremacists fueling the care more about the Confederate flag than the American one, about monuments to racism than reciting the words to a national anthem they dont even know, and burning their shoes instead of donating 
Its funny that all these WP are burning their Nike products. The gag is that black people buy waaaayyy more Nike products then yall. So have fun thinking youre making a difference
I stopped Nike after the womens oppression hijab!what company would be ok with womens oppression?Nike thats who
Maybe you racist Loons could have a block party, instead of piling up books in the middle of the street, pile up your shoes and socks, then burn them. Nothing like a good old-fashioned modern day racist bonfire.
Hi racists. I wear a size 4. If you are a woman who wants to o burn her new Nike running gear, can you consider giving it to me instead?
The whites are at it again
The is... something... but if you think it's going to hurt Nike sales you've got another thought coming. Black dollars move culture.
Here's how the is racist:
NO if you don't want them give them to the homeless or kid sizes to the boys and girls club. Take them SOMEWHERE to donate. There are underprivileged people who would give their last dollar for the shit you take for granted.
The only american who could benefit from the , if white Nationalist, can stomach giving him their money, or it's give their money to german companies Puma & Adidas, or british company Reebok. You guys are the 'Buy American' 'America first' crowd, buy his shoes.
you white hoes are so mad loll I love it
Conservatives are known for lighting many beautiful things on fire. Their crosses, torches, people of color, etc.
Tucker Carlson angrier over Nike's Colin Kaepernick Ad than with the white supremacist terror attack in Charlottesville: Tucker Carlson Decries Nike's Kaepernick Ad: 'This Is An Attack on the Country'
Here's a idea people. Instead of burning and cutting your clothes proving to the world that you're both racist and ignorant. How about donating those clothes to the troops and vets you're pretending to care about.
Richard youre a god dam idiot hahahah the whites are at it again
is the dumbest thing. People are really burning products they paid money for to prove a point to a bunch of executives that dont know they exist. People really dont have a problem with him kneeling,they have a problem with a black man that has influence being heard
"Yeah, I got these shoes from an America racist who was doing the thing."This isn't a bowling alley, and you don't wanna wear an American racist's sweaty bacteria filled shoes ...Don't donate your Nikes, racist loons, go ahead and burn them. For America.
We should start a ! said every middle aged white male who is currently wearing New Balance.
Being able to destroy your Nike items, thats privilege. Think about it.
The whites are at it again
If you agree with you're a moron. And a racist.
Is America Racist?
please ask all of your crew to send me all their ! i will make sure they go to the veterans out here in LA. as you know a lot of them dont have shoes / jobs / homes / privilege.
Can you lame privileged fuckboy hypebeast ass clowns participate in the so real heads can get merchandise without a hassle ?
How do you tell a white supremacist from a regular white person? White supremacists have droopy socks.
I love the ironya by ignorant racist rednecks who wear dollar store shoes anywaywhat total fuckwits
The is proving that white people value their privilege over the lives of people of color.Really? What about the people of color working in Nikes sweatshops for $3 per day? I guess their lives dont matter as much as a pair of overpriced sneakers.
I hope every professional athlete signed by Nike who sees through the lies promoted by a mixed man, raised by a white adoptive family after his black father walked out on him, sues to get out of their contract for reasons of an unforseen shift in company core values.
I love it when "capitalists" take stupid, barely symbolic stances against corporations in favor of racism and bigotry.Keep outing yourselves, y'all.Please never go back into your klanholes again. We like you out here where we can name/shame you.
Any of you white crackers dont want your brand new Nike leftovers you can send them my way
Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, in response to police brutality in America. Why is anyone offended?
Correction: You are a racist
Imagine being so racist that youd rather not watch your favorite sport or wear your favorite shoes anymore.
The fucking whites are at it again you completely missed the point lady
What was Colin Kaepernick's issue? Oh yeah, white oppression!
I love it when a boycott backfires on bigoted people. This is the best advertising Nike could ever hope for. The so-called is Helping Nike!
My immediate thoughts are that The whites are at it again
People are burning their Nike gear rather than admit that a black man has voice. Stay strong . I'm gonna go buy a new pair of . No
Racists, Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists and fascist are the only ones participating in this
Really these racist rednecks want a this is crazy I didn't even know they wear Nike I thought they wore those hiking shoes from Walmart in the back where you get the baby stuff. SMH
all these so called Americans destroying their Nike products, are exactly what is wrong with this country! So many triggered snowflakes over a man standing up for equality for all, what tf is so wrong about that?!
All the people are white. Coincidence?
White Privilege? I know of no employment or school applications that give special treatment to whites - they of course do for others. So we hire people that can't do the best job! Applications should be color blind and hiring based on capability.
Hey ! I encourage you to get this angry over police brutality and institutional racism.
Are The Police Racist?
The whites are at it again
This really have people showing their real true colors I see. Ignorance isn't a disease but it's sure as hell spreading like one.
Guess my family and I will be adding to our collection while these racist people are having a instead of donating their unwanted Nike items to the that they claim to live so much.
The whites are at it again
Are you kidding me with the bullshit? Sometimes I really hate white people.
Anyone who is tweeting "you're racist for boycotting Nike" and doesn't mention Vietnamese sweat shops or wouldn't walk through a project in Chicago alone at night you might want to become "woke" to your institutionalized indoctrination into the liberal think tank
Ppl out here cutting and burning Nikes thats over five years old. They dont care about your outlet shopping tantrum throwing white ass.
When a black man kneeling is a threat to powerful white people, you know that fear and racism run deep.
I love it when a boycott backfires on bigoted people. This is the best advertising Nike could ever hope for. The so-called is Helping Nike!
Don't burn your Nike X Off-White. Give em to me instead
The whites are at it again
White supremacists fueling the care more about the Confederate flag than the American one, about monuments to racism than reciting the words to a national anthem they dont even know, and burning their shoes instead of donating them to the veterans they claim to love
lol white twitter got trending
So a bunch of old white people who watch and never do anything more athletic than lift a can of beer are going to boycott shoes and apparel? I'm sure Nike is quaking in their sneakers.
real question?. How many white athletes have Nike sneaker deals?
oh look more whiny racist bootlickers. Please make sure to burn your nikes while still wearing them. I hear they burn faster that way
if you're participating in the you're an idiot, and probably a racist. have a terrible day! :)
Lots of under privileged Americans would gladly take your shoes off your hands.
Donate the clothes instead of ruining them so underprivileged people can have it
The whites are at it again with the
The is solid proof that conservatism is a terminal mental disorder, and is inseparable from racist values.
The face I make when white fragility starts to crack like eggshells and they start burning sneakers instead of crosses .
bring back slavery? isnt that ??
Fuck racism
All of these weird white folk. Smh
get Y'all white ass on y'all wear under armour anyway police aas clothes

So many issues going on in America, Puerto Rico still doesn't have power! Veterans still need better insurance & shelter and we are mad bc Colin K. Chose to stand against inequality of this country and ppl want 2 ? You're part of the issue if u condone this nonsense
In directly related news, irrelevant gains more recognition for being an ignorant racist fool than hell ever have as a part of some lame band.
blah blah blah!!! Nike will be fine! Dont pay attention to the noise!! The bigots, deplorables, and racists wont win!!
Pledge of Allegiance and the Star Spangled Banner are not about racism. They're about a and only IGNORANT people would equate it to something else. If you make millions here playing a game THEN honor the country that allows it!
I dont give af bout this yall got me fucked up nike aint never did me or kno black person wrong without Nike there would be no Jordan
This the shoe that racist people wear anyways.
It's only for those who believe blacks deserve to die without reason.
would you ask an ex-white supremacist to donate their gear to black, the nike swoosh is now a symbol of American hate
*ties shoe strings on crispy pair of black Air Force ones* not today.
People tripping at but are okay with having a racist P.O.S as our president.
this has to do with racial discrimination and why?
People are apparently taking to social media to destroy their shoes after Nike named Colin Kaepernick their new spokesperson.Why not donate them to your local homeless shelter? The least you can do is let someone less fortunate benefit off your PRIVILEGE.
Another Black Eye for the NFL.
Crazy how only whites people are in the lol more shoes for me then
Lol white nationalists are ripping up their Nikes due to ad, clearly unaware majority of s workers are visible minorities.
That's fine. Something tells me that unathletic racists aren't their target audience.
If anyone of the folks has a pair of off-white 1s they cant stomach to own, let me dispose of them for you.
lol idgaf as long as you don't directly affect me do whatever you want. Picked up my first Js got some black grape 5s.
Rednecks, Racists, White supremacists and bunch of losers are the people asking for a
Yes yall bringing the issues to the surface. Any white person that I see boycotting will automatically be considered a racist...PERIOD
How many racists participating in the are gonna give their Nike products to homeless veterans?
What is it with racists and fire?
Nothing says like racist dicks burning expensive gear to try and rebrand their racist ideals with patriotism. Bunch of dumbasses. Go and most definitely go makes up prouder
There's a lot of white guilt on Twitter this morning.
If anyone wants to boycott by throwing their shoes away, I will pay for you to ship them to me & Ill ensure a person living in poverty who needs shoes will get them... please stop being wasteful
offwhite decided to unds finally
What rules America is a white supremacist system..But, it has no say so on how we send our black dollars..We got you !
It shows y'all how ignorant you country bumpkin racist mfs are smh
I see some woke White People snapping this morning
is now arguably the dumbest thing to happen in 2018. I don't even care for football but anyone with the slightest common sense and reading skills knows that it's all about police brutality. Now racists are fake mad about a situation Trump manipulated in his favor.
would you ask an ex-white supremacist to donate their old gear? Why would anyone want to wear a symbol of American hate??
To all yall idiots burning Nike products...especially off white kicks...before you think about burning anything else you can dm me and we can get a shipping process going
These rednecks like would waste energy on a racist boycott.
Maybe these racist feet hurt maybe they should try dr scholls
There is a difference between white people and white supremacists.
You racist bastards want to burn up your Nike clothes go ahead you payed for it. Nike got they check already dumb asses
would you ask an ex-white supremacist to donate their old gear? Why would anyone want to wear a symbol of American hate??
Nike has sucked since the latter 80s when they went to Malaysia and gave those workers slave wages. Haven't worn anything Nike since then, and I lived in Beaverton where their HQ are located. DON'TDoIt
would you ask an ex-white supremacist to donate their old gear? Why would anyone want to wear a symbol of American hate??
Hey 550 KTSA Instead of participating in this you should try boycotting White Supremacy instead of defending it.
would you ask an ex-white supremacist to donate their old gear? Why would anyone want to wear a symbol of American hate??
Less racists in Nikes
All these privileged ass white kids are burning the 's their parents bought them
The mentality of these racists. Cutting out a Nike sign will not refund your money, so why destroy something u paid for? Haters
It's funny be show there true colors on the internet but never in person. thrives on the internet but yet they say it doesn't exist.
is how dumb Leftist think:LeBron James: ‚ÄòTook me a little while to accept white people' 'But when they give me their stupid money, I like white people'Buried into an article.
would you ask an ex-white supremacist to donate their old gear to blacks? Why would a veteran want to wear a symbol of American hate??
So racists want a ? do they know any black people at all?
Nike Boycott > White Plight
Its ! and fuck the racists who want to start a !
They made their bed, now they have to live with it. Racist rednecks??? Morons?? Are you that hateful towards people who think spitting on the flag, burning it, kneeling during the National Anthem is wrong? You stoop to a 1st grade level? show them what disrespect is.
He's half white (raised by whites)....
Pastor at Aretha Franklin funeral stands by fiery anti-Black Lives Matter eulogy amid angry uproar.
I wish we wouldve boycotted over the child slave labor but Ill take it
was about disrespecting the flag for Colin:I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.- Colin Kaepernick
It's politics, not race
Only racists wear
If any racists wanna give me their Nikes instead of destroying them, my DMs are open. Im size 13.
Hey Bigots! how about sending ur Clothes to people in Puerto Rico for citizens who lost everything! Wait that'll be too humane for you heartless Fucks
Penalized by receiving multimillion dollar shoe contracts, coming off a multimillion dollar football contract. Yeah, super racist country we have here dude.
It's about politics, not race
white people talking bout boycotting Nike like they care multi Billion dollar company  they really could care less ...
imagine valuing songs and privilege and flags above the actual lives of nonwhite people that you destroy clothes you already paid for. this is like when u dumb bitches tried to boycott Starbucks by buying their coffee under tr*mps name. ur FUCKIN IDIOTS.
$200 for a pair of shoes made in sweat shop in China, while pretending to be down with ? Sheeiiit! If trully cared about plight of Black Americans, they would be making their shoes in the Southside of Chicago, Detroit, or Baltimore.
White twitter mad as shit lmfao
If youre boycotting Nike, youre racist sweetie. Plain and simple. Seek professional help.
This is what's wrong with America. How have we fallen so far back that we are in the time of racism being normal? This is the kind of shit that doesn't belong in America.
A short tale of brave white nationalism
So...if you disagree with and his anti-police attitude....that is yet another thing that makes you a "racist?" Yep...keep proving that that word means absolutely nothing any longer.
and to the racist client base is losing ...
To all these racist fuckwits joining the Nike already have your money, they dont give a fuck what you do with them And theyll more than make up the sales with the non-fascists of the world, buying even more of their stuff
White America is defending it's racism.
white culture at its finest
SCIENTIFIC PROOF THAT RACISM EQUALS RETARDATION
Most ppl on Twitter with this dont wear the brand anyway. They are purely keyboard klansmen with their underlying racist rhetoric.
You guys are so racist it makes no sense lets argue
Its such a nice feeling to know that Bigots and Racists cheers
The only people who dont look like complete douche bags when buying 100+$ pair of shoes are Blacks and Asians
Going through the hashtag and trolling bitter white people is too fun.
Lol all these racists burning their dirty, 10 yr old worn out ass smelly bargain bin Nikes like its some power move.
I wanna see off white nikes or air mags being burn not some cheap running nikes u can find in outlets
Any Mayonnaises thinking of burning some Off-Whites in a 10.5?
The people who are boycotting Nike, should boycot their racism and hate.
The only thing I need to decide this morning is which one of my many colors of Nike's match better with my outfit....Maybe I should wear a whole Nike outfit
Wonder if the crowd will remove their child from scholarship provided collegiate sports teams in an effort to stand behind their ignorance and racism i'm guessing not. Fake angry for no reason.
The upset folks cutting up their Nike gear probably have the 5% of stuff I would never wear anyway. I mean white socks? Gross
Destroying products to prove a point instead of donating them is privilege.
White people talking about a damn you people never cease to amaze me. Boycott these nuts bitch.
The power of the black $$, now yall are the minority population. Let that sink in...
The advocates of the are not only exposing themselves as comprehensively racist (as strongly as they deny it), but also strongly demonstrating white privilege by destroying perfectly good clothing which could be donated to those they say are being disrespect.
I only see racist white people upset
And its only the whites participating in this go fucking figure.
ONLY RACISTS ARE BOYCOTTING BYE HATERS
I remember way back, tearing logos off my classics and writing Amos 8:6 ("they buy the poor for a pair of shoes") in their place. (Intense kid.) Haven't bought Nikes since. The problem isn't damaging your clothes. It's colonialism and antiblack racism.
"When they go low we go high!" Thank you for kneeling when we were low at the moment even though they tried to degrade you. Now look, you're flying high now! Thank you for standing against racism!
BREAKING NEWS Angry White people are burning stuff up
I love that racist white people are doing a They wear lol!
Who else instantly knew was made up of salty white tears before even clicking? Go ! Go !
you are a complete disgrace. Make shoes in sweat shops on the backs of child labor, charge hundreds of dollars for and now to completely stomp on the sacrifices of this country by giving a larger platform. You guys suck!
Breaking News. To all the bigots tweeting , these are not Dont burn your only decent pair of sneakers.
I wonder when the NFL rats will start talking about black on black violence! Instead they want to hate and destroy law and order!! Nike is in the wrong side of history! Fuck them!
Maybe Racists doing the can be officially sponsored by Fruit of The Loons.
Why would anyone wear something made by slaves in the first place
I really doubt that Nike is worried about losing the fat white racists behind
anyone destroying their Nike gear bec they are racists are morons.
: Nike stock down nearly 3% in premarket trading in wake of ad controversy and resulting . The decline is equal to an estimated $300 million loss.
Dear outraged white people. Nike owns converse as well. So all of the pairs you have with your favorite screaming band signatures on them have to get burned too.
I too am jumping on this train. For the , please send all size 10.5 air maxs and air force ones my way. I accept all colors
White Supremacist is about as smart as mice getting trapped in a glass bowl with peanut oil in it. You dumb son of a prejudice idiots are burning clothes that youve already purchased !!!!
Of course is trending. How dare Nike disrespect the American Flag... Hows about instead of burning or throwing away your Nike clothing, all you racist morons give them to charities, or perhaps injured soldiers - You know, the ones you love so greatly.
So many white kids are about to be mad at their parents when they get taken shoe shopping this year.
Looking for all the smoke signals of racists joining the . They're burning their shoes y'all
And yet changing the American flag colors to black, white, and blue isnt disrespecting the flag.
All of the people boycotting nike, thanks for posting cute videos and pics. We now know you are racists but seeing you destroy pricey clothes to show how pissed you are is pathetic.
I'm sure there's a shoe/clothing company out there willing to be the official sponsor of racists who are burning their shoes to . Let's check.
White conservatives from middle America arent the driving force behind fashion and sneaker head culture. Black people are. So good luck with yall .
And yet the guy you voted for for president cant color in his stripes correctly.
Look at all the bigots and racists on the left attacking anyone who are boycotted Nike.
is about people raised to define patriotism only in the image of their racism. Their American patriotism is a side in a war in a foreign land, but at home they are Confederates who demand punishment for non-white people who don't accept white supremacy as the rule.
Watching people burn these Nike products it really have a lot of racist people in America. Yall dont have this much passion when blacks are killed by the police for no reason
Oh look, white privilege and fragility wrapped into one asinine tweet.
Disgraceful
Black & White
Don't burn your nikes, a Vietnamese child slave worked super hard on them
Colin shouldn't have to take a knee in order to bring awareness about racism and police brutality. This is a problem. This is something we should all be aware of and stop it.
in a positive development we will be better able to recognize racists by their burnt shoes and missing swoosh...
The national anthem is a sacred ritual of our most sacred emblem, "hands up don't shoot" was a lie and u know it. Also, studies prove that whites cops killing black people is not a thing, more propaganda you regurgitate. you cannot denigrate America and make profit
Im tired of my skin color dictating how Im treated. That Black bodies are seen as a threat. I dont wanna fear my boyfriend or any of my family wont make it home. Im tired of having the ‚Äòtalk with my black men about making it home safe if stopped by a cop.
Racists are livid after finding out NIKE is not down with white supremacy after all.
Instead of burning your clothes give it to people in need stupid white privileged losers
Controversy equals $$$$$$ remember that
I hope Re release their whole off white collection and all the jordan 1 today so I could see how real this is lol. Clowns
I'd rather be screamed at by angry white people upset at my criticism of their faux outrage than see another child gunned down by police for the crime of playing in a park while black.
I'm NOT white, proudly voted 4 my homie Mr. Donald J. Trump, and have NOT bought a Nike since HS. Nike's r made by slave labor in Chinese sweatshops. The irony was hired to promote their brand is sad.! And YES: !
Racists are livid after finding out NIKE is not down with white supremacy after all.
Looks like is angry at a black guy again.
Do people realize by cutting their clothes doesnt hurt Nike? Thats one less pair of socks, shorts or shoes YOU have. These racists werent talking about when they had horrible labor conditions. Im sleep tho.
FINALLY! A WOKE PERSON OF COLOR THAT UNDERSTANDS WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE AN AMERICAN AND BOYCOTT THAT HORRIBLE BRAND!
all the left has is calling people racist. They have lost.
The whole point of kneeling is to bring awareness to racism not the flag. How many times does that have to be reiterated? Its truly sad but go off I guess.
I'm pretty sure racists wear new balance.........
Nike: How do we become cool again?Also Nike: Lets piss off white people.
with privileges are super blind to the facts.. Burning your hardworking dollars make you look stupid, not
Now we gon see at practice and games who REALLY got racist parents when these white kids start showin up with holes in they gear
So are you admitting your racism? Who is "they"?
Only racist white people are doing this >> <<
White supremacist, big foot, leprechauns have always hated
Hey guys!! Did you ever notice that when we the resistance threatens to boycott a company, the company does a quick about face and/or even fire folks, but when the racist pro-trump people threaten to boycott; it's a epic fail and the companies increase their sales.
If you knew *really* happened to Pat Tillman, you would have enough respect for him and his family not to drag them into your racist masquerade!
All you people are doing is showing your ignorant, selfish, and bigotry ways..
Nike makes good shoes, and I believe in meritocracy. I will not destroy my shoes nor participate in will however say that people on the left are missing the point here.Disliking on Kaepernick has nothing to do with racism.
if u insist to boycott then you are a racist.
sell clothes to billions of people, I'm sure a few asshole white supremacists aren't gonna affect their bottom line, too much.
Translation: We don't want racial equality and we're terrified that we've lost our white supremacy
I wonder what kinda of hats white people are gonna wear now that they can't wear nike dad caps backwards. Perhaps some sort of pointed white hood?
When you side with race baiters
White man bad. White man bad. Yards yadda yadda
Making a racist think during a football game is now a fire hazard
The is testament to Americas (not so underlying) racism that still looms over its flag. A man who - agree with him or not - stood up for what he believed in.... thought thats what America stood for.
you have disgraced the memory of A TRUE HERO with your "new" ad of washed up, cry baby, disrespectful & loser -
Lmfaoooo yall white people this mad at Nike for featuring African American in their ads. Have fun burning things you paid for.... they still have your money at the end of the day
I see "You white people??" ... PURLEY RACIST
Fuck all that merc shit... are you racist quitting your nike jobs so more ppl can climb that nike job ladder?
COLIN IS NOT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE... PERIOD! HE IS FOR THOSE BRAINWASHED LIBERALS THAT HATE WHITE PEOPLE AND COMPLAIN ABOUT FAUX OPPRESSION ALL DAY!
Yall taking party in the ? Let me go ahead and give my black dollar.
giving away all my all white air force ones P.S. they beat up and faded
It's truly sad how White Americans truly don't see a problem. The whole POINT of kneeling is to bring awareness to racism not the FLAG!!!!! How many times does that have to be reiterated? It's truly sad and ignorant but go off I guess.
FYI, to all the asshats slicing their socks, homeless men need those socks. Try being productive in your bigotry.
I will be wearing my Nike's with pride while taking a knee with Kaepernick against racism, police profiling, don't shoot, prison pipeline.
If you dont believe in racism these ppl SICK
This hashtag is really outing all those closet racists
You white people are sad. I hope yall get beat for being this dense
is probably relieved that all these racists won't be sporting their label under their white robes. is stupid.I'm buying Nike!
White ppl maddd asffff
dumb fucks!!....racist bigots
y'all white folks that's ..... y'all retarded as hell
Dear Mad white people, Shut up.
hey bro..good job choosing to be black 4 years ago...its all those years u were white is where I have the problem. Btw, my raven beat that ass, never forget it u fuckin loser.
I wonder if all the black people clowning whites for burning there Nike shoes were clowning blacks when they burned there Cleveland jerseys. Probably not. It's not a "White" thing it's an American thing. Burn it all.
I will never buy another item from again. What a disgrace.
Whats with racists and burning stuff? Crosses, churches, books, jerseys, shoes, brain cells to name a few.
Ive noticed that the people boycotting Nike for not being racist enough for them have absolutely terrible grammar. But Im sure their racism has nothing to do with being uneducated.
Since middle aged white guys are does this mean I will finally stop seeing half bald old guys with beer guts wearing beat to shit Air Monarchs?
I don't do boycotts, but the entire premise for the take a knee movement is a lie, blacks are not constant victims of racism in 2018.
Im not even mad about means all the bigots can go back to their camouflage deer huntin bomber jackets, car greased jeans and construction boots
To all of you boycotting.... burn your racism along with your Nike stuff too. And you!
The was so predictable. Except, what the Trumpians don't get is:Sneakers? Your whiteness has no power here! Ain't NOBODY but y'all trying to rock the w/ khakis!Black kids run the sneaker biz, son. Boycott away!
Why is this even a thing ... Clearly there are better things to do with time .. Boycotting an entity that promotes hard work and SOCIAL equality is a bit concerning
Congratulations Trump BRAINWASHED ASSHOLE maggots YOU SUCK THE GUY IS A 40 YR CON ARTIST LYING PEICE OF SHIT SUED LIKE 4000 TIMES FOR FUCKING PEOPLE But BE A DICK YOUR PRIVILEGEDGO WORSHIP YOUR MESSIAH ASSHOLE
The ones boycotting are all white people Snowflakes!
How I'm about to leave Nike now with 272773 pairs of shoes I've always wanted. Thanks white people
Anyone boycotting Nike is racist.
All these racists are doing the . Considering Adidas was started by a Nazi, this seems like a fitting act by America's Nazi party, the GOP.
Two of 12 members of Nikes board are POC. Nikes entire top management teamall 8 top positions from CEO and president down? All white
I bet for every white dude throwing out his shoes, theres a black dude buying 2 pairs.
Donc Kaepernick qui fait une affiche pour Nike et donc les blancs racistes am√©ricains d√©chirent leurs v√™tements ?! Dont change anything my friends, stay dumb, its the best outfit for you !
The majority of baby boomers who are of white colored skin seem to be the angriest of all about the new nike ad. Colin is the new Martin Luther King JR of the new age!
I havent seen one pair of goood Nikes burned. Its been all Nikes that needed to go out the door soon anyway the racist aint fooling nobody.
elimination of a symbol that represents hate is as American as apple pie. Kaepernick represents anti-police anti-American viewpoints. If black lives mattered they would be in Chicago every weekend, instead crickets. There all fake, burn it all.
When they have no argument they call you racist and ask that you don't respond.
I'm not surprised at they showed their true colors when they moved their manufacturing operations over seas. Most of the factories are located in Asia, including Indonesia, China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, Philippines, and Malaysia.
I would imagine is thing to have a field day with the . You know she doesn't like black folks either..
Look, the Deplorables are adding to their "I'm white and I'm butthurt over something new card".
? Careful, your white privilege is showing. And your white hoods.
You would boycott Nike before you boycott police brutality. Ugh.
The model manages to look this smug in every single picture. By the way, those colored contacts are cultural appropriation.
Nike only wants people of color to buy their products, not be part of their actual team. Nikes entire management teamall 8 top executive positionsis a sea of white. .
White People who would rather let their kids go to school barefoot than think critically about racism: I see you. We all see you. It is time you see yourself.
Kaepernick wore a T shirt of Castro, a dictator who banned complaints about racism & oppressed his people"I'm going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed"Kaepernick do it
"Buy local! Fair wages! End Child labor!"*****sees how mad folks are about Nike burning shoes*****"Nike is amazing! Check out the Nike Air Max Typha 2! "- People who only point out other's hypocrisy
Man, Republicans really hate black people.
He needs to be concerned about black on black crime. MLK already did the job.
I'd love to join the except I don't do sports so I don't own any of their products and also I'm not a racist crap sack.
aye somebody buy me a few pairs of gear so I can wear them too.*cough cough*I meant cut them up too. Buy me some Black and Gold foams size 9.5 so I can destroy them.
Athletes: we kneel to bring attention to police brutality Them: no you don't, it's disrespecting the flag A: has nothing to do w the flag T: yes it does , and the troopsA: no, and cutting up your nike stuff you already bought isn't boycottingT: yes it isA: ok
The left has already deprived the term racist of any significance, so why would the term sacrifice be any different?
So now I hear theres a boycott for Nike for what cuz they signed Colin? Damn white people ya really hate to see a black man win ya took football from him what more do ya want.
While you racist fucks participate in a make sure to add their other subsidiaries; Converse and Hurley.
So racist are now on the CRY bitches
White people face when they found out is owned by
This shows how racist the country is trying to Colin
You racist mfs are crazy lmfao
I wanna see you racists destroying your $200 Jordans tho
White people barely buy Nike's this is irrelevant
White people face when the find out is owned by
Having white supremacists boycotting you sounds like good P.R.
Liberals like to say that if a Conservative says anything negative about a woman or a black person that we are sexist, racist or both. Such bullshit!
Hello white supremacists, hows yall racist morning being ignorant today?
When you see a bunch of racist rednecks tweeting about this and how they're going to tank the stock prices of the largest, most recognizable brand in the world, all while being totally unaware the company made $34.35 billion in 2017. Burn your socks, morons.
y'all had any goddamn sense, you wouldn't boycot Nike. Kap's stand against police brutality and racism. He sacrificed a whole lot, even if you don't see it.Your efforts in war are great, I guess, but y'all are immature shits tearing up SHOES FFS. Donate them.
Way to whitewash the problem.
Sometimes I wonder how Jason Whitlock still has a job, and then I see white folx destroying stuff they already paid for in the and it all makes sense.
This is why there is outrage. Its not about race people.
Dis got all yawl racist muhfukkas showing your true self and yawl all still ugly inside and out
no more sales for is a disgrace to
The leftists are out precondemning the as racist. I guess when the stock gets clocked the stock market will also be racist. What a bunch of jackasses.
? whew chile.. the racism jumped out
:Boycotters: Stop disrespecting the military & vets!Military: they're not & the kneeling was a military veterans idea.NFL players: it's about police brutality.Nike: we agree this is a problem.B's: LET'S BURN OUR OWN STUFF!Everyone: but, the vets in need?
Want to talk about hypocrites, Colin Kaepernick is fighting for equality yet accepted a contract worth millions from a company that was built on sweatshops and unfair labor practices
now burning all of my Nike equipment and apparel will never buy Nike again! You don't care about all of the black lives there being killed in the End by Black criminals! You are truly racist!
So y'all devils rather burn clothes than give them to the homeless? Says a lot about why there is a going on now! You Racist, Selfish, Privileged of s!
So when (not if) the cops shot another unarmed black man in the back, do you promise to retweet or that doesn't fit your narrative?
Nike is smart theyre going to have more black people buying Nike and all the white people who probably dont wear Nike but buys it to prove theyre not racist.
LIST OF RACIST PRO-TRUMP BOYCOTTS THAT COMPLETELY BACKFIRED: Amazon Krueger, Nordstrom's Macy's, Netflix, Apple, Starbucks, Walmarts. All have tripled in sales. WELCOME TO THE WINNING TEAM NIKE!
If any of you participants who live in the Gulf Coast area would like to donate your Nike apparel to an organization that really helps people, contact The Home of Grace.
The crowd is siding with the unhinged president. Not enough police brutality. We already know they dont care about patriotism.
I got time today with these white folks and this
I cannot believe I've allowed myself to think for more than 3 seconds about what redneck hillbilly bigots aren't going to wear anymore.
Theyll boycott everything except the blatant racism
When your white privilege is so ginger you have to ruin your own possessions to protect it.
The homelessness rate of veterans is a disgrace. The poverty rate of veterans is a disgrace. The difficulty veterans have accessing healthcare is a disgrace. The mental health battles that veterans often fight alone are a disgrace.
True fact in the time of slavery we bread African americans to work harder to pick cotton now that slavery is over look how many sports african americans are dominant in. Kaeperernick is the racist and shows no respect for the U.S.A
You guys are fucking Morons if you think Nike gives af if your boycotting then or not. Dumb racist ass white people. Continue to wear your crocs and sanuks ty
is about Nike marketing themselves as more diverse and not marketing themselves to the annoying and opinionated 60 year old white male. Nike will gain younger people. Thats why Nike is king.
Someone explain to me how kneeling during the anthem is equal to disrespecting troops or the flag (of this stolen country built on illegal labor)?
Look at how History judges baseball fans who boycotted Major League Baseball after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.None of these people are remembered.Boycott Nike all you want, but the only person who will be remembered by history is Colin Kaepernick!
Im looking at these post & pics chuckling. Nike is really not worried about them $45 vinyl white sneakers yall are wearing.
Don't burn your Nikes Burn your racism
If anyone of y'all patriots feel like destroying your off-white AJ1's, please send them to me and I'll make sure they get taken care of.
You, are you about racism or ?
White Ppl
We bet if Nike came out with the Confederate 9s, Slave Catcher Edition, they would quickly change their mind with this boycott
Black people are the ones who made nikes cool anyway
Is the fueled by racism?
Look at how History judges baseball fans who boycotted Major League Baseball after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.None of these people are remembered.Boycott Nike all you want, but the only person who will be remembered by history is Colin Kaepernick!
So you WASHED up, brain washed WHITE ppl think Colin kneeling is a problem ? Look at your OWN congress dont
Lmaooo woke up to lmfao racism is crazy
White supremacist woke up like
I'd prefer that were the celebrity face of food or oxygen, so the racist boycott would actually thin the herd of assholes.
Lmfao yall mad about a flag not being respected yet do absolutely nothing to help the Veterans and if you did there wouldn't be a high number of them still homeless without any healthcare. Also proving you DON'T care about the mistreatment of black ppl by the police.
Nike ended OPPRESSION by giving Kaepernick a shoe deal for kneeling.
When you've burned all your gear and you don't want your racist friends to see you at
I retired from the Army after 20 years. My son will also be going in once he turns 17 years old. It doesnt offend me if anyone sits, stands, sleeps, or lay down thru the anthem. What does is the killing of innocent black ppl by the police.
i will do everything in my power to never let anyone buy nike products again. kapernick is a piece of shit. he was raised by white people and grew up in the suburbs. how the hell does he even think he knows about black lives?he is trash and now so is nike .
I wonder if all of these weirdos realize they're telling on themselves. It can only be racism Nike products have been made in sweatshops for decades they don't care about that... While typing on their iPhones who also get their parts made in sweatshops.
White folks are really mad lmao......
Your move, bigots...
Enjoy your bobos, racist conservatives
Noone sees the issue with Nike, a company that takes advantage of poor black people who waste money on shoes. So they praise them for starting a campaign to sell more shoes in the hood by linking onto this ex football player?
You burning your shit lets me know you dont care about black people & POC.
Imma get a Nike Swoosh on each one of my car doors and hood and park it in a shitty predominantly white country town for a few days, shiiiit, Kaepernick aint the only nigga finna get paid by Nike one way or another, im finna cash me a good little insurance check
If you have a problem with Nike standing against racism and police brutality. YOU are the problem.
Gotta hit up the thrift stores and Goodwill's soon to get some of the new Nike stuff that's gonna be coming in from all the racists
You never know how racist someone is until you read a hashtag . Lol bc is dumb asf !!
I guess are done trashing a former POW during his funeral and are now back to pretending it's black people who are the unpatriotic ones.
These racist who are boycotting Nike are acting like they got actual Nikes to burn...don't lie...your Twitter fingers are burning while you sit in your Avias from Walmart.
I gave my patent leather black high heeled IVanka shoes to someone in need. In need of a pair a black pumps. Haha . I didnt burn them!
If Nike drop a Kaepernick shoe, it would become the modern day symbol for fighting institutional racism and police brutality
Nope! Nike is NOT the Sports Gear for Racist White Supremacists!
If all of the racist bumpkins out there joining in on the can keep up their pseudo patriotism until November, it'd make it a hell of a lot easier for me to pick up these Air Jordan V reissues. Thanks in advance.
(Spend Your Sports-Wear Money Buying, "Keep-America-Great", Trump 2020 Re-Election Red Caps Instead) (Nike Is A Cultural Marxist, Racist Enabler) !!
my entire family will be burning everything with a swoosh on it. Colin Kapernick is a joke and now your brand it too. Your true colors are showing.
Mad white people are comical man Im enjoying watching this hashtag
Check it out! dishamunshi will design professional flyer, brochures in 5hours for $10 on Zhanshu,John Millman,Gulf Coast,East Hills,Blackpink
I wonder if racists would still be all over this if they knew that so many Nike products were made by child slaves?
The interesting thing about the is that there's no way that that a company as big as Nike did this blindly.They did the math. They checked the sums. And they decided that they'd make more money actively rejecting racists than staying silent.That's a big deal.
If youre destroying your Nike merchandise youre not being patriotic, youre being idiotic. In fact, youre proclaiming loud and clear that you dont give a damn about Black people!
Boy, this is as dumb as it is racist and not surprising. America truly is the loud, trashy, ignorant family in the global neighborhood. Dragging humanity's property value down. A constant disappointment to everyone living nearby. Fan-fucking-tastic. Once again.
These people really love police brutality. Like really love it. Enough to burn their own shoes for their love of police brutality.
This sounds a lot like a bunch of triggered Liberals. I get it. Kap is a cop hating, America hating bigot. Fine. At some point, however, someone in this country has to start acting like the adult. Do we really have to try to ruin everyone we disagree with?
MFW when poor, 65-IQ black people are laughing at
And how about donating your gear as well--I'm sure that would be equally appreciated! lol
Check it out! dishamunshi will create amazing and professional t shirt design for $10 on Zhanshu,John Millman,Gulf Coast,East Hills,Blackpink
Lol r American being racist again???
For all who say racism don't exist go to Twitter, search , and read the first 10 tweets lol.
For that old white supremacist friend you lost touch with
These racist who are so ignorant they can't figure out by burning something they purchased already doesn't hurt Nike Nike should put out a special sneaker with flames for these racists making an effigy of Kaepernick via shoe Lynching & Burnning Black Pple I see you
Racism and common sense have never seen eye to eye
Anyone joining the please donate your Nikes to a Veterans' Organization or a homeless shelter--do good racism--it's a thing.
Soooo those saying are basically saying yes, I agree with police brutality, racism etc. Ok then. At least we know who the racists are now! Also, if you wish to destroy your Nike gear, may I offer the suggestion of giving it to charity instead of destroying it?
IF YOU ARE GOING TO THEN YOU ARE A RACIST! OK WITH COPS MURDERING AFRICAN AMERICANS THEN YOU ARE THE DAMN PROBLEM! YOU ARE THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO BE BOYCOTTED FROM BREATHING AIR DUMBASS!
So is the today. Ill stick with the president whos a , disrespects the rule of law, harms children, assaults women, doesnt know the words to the national anthem, cant color a flag, pays off mistresses, and is completely inept.
And while you're at it, how about also donating all your gear--I'm sure they will be equally appreciated!
I applaud for not giving a fuck about what white, conservative, fake ass patriots think.
This reeks of racism and white supremacy
How many people were shot last month in Chicago? How many were shot this last weekend? Nike should get behind that if they really feel Black Lives Matter!
These white people mad mad!
What exactly are they boycotting? Nike never got into making KKK white robes or confederate flags in the first place.
Build a wall to keep out all the white supremacist in this country ! Sick of this shit! thanks you for standing up!!!!
Old white Americans are back at it again with this
How white liberals feel when they tweet about
Will never buy Nike products again. Nike, please refrain from making anything with the colors RED, WHITE or BLUE in them. Also, your "military discount" is a slap in the face.
Watching all these privileged whiteys cut up or burn their Nike apparel in a hissy fit over a spokesman soothes me.
So if yall are boycotting Nike with your fake patriotism (racism) why not donate them to that homeless vet you know you drove by the other day GTFOH
I was at on Friday and when CK's picture was put up he got as load an ovation as any of other celebrities and no boos that I heard. And that audience was mostly white and well over 20. Nike may well know what it's doing
& others willing to boycott for hiring . Pls send your items to my PO BOX. I will ship them to underprivileged kids in West Africa. Pls do not burn these items - they are costly. Lets do something great! Thanks in advance
Current happening by the White Nationalist Party.
Colin Kaepernick seized on the false narrative that cops are bigoted vs blacks in the hopes of prolonging his failing career. His black base is lapping up the toxic snake oil FIFY
honestly we don't care if y'all white folks don't wanna buy Nike. We're the ones that made it hot and popular. Stick to Sketchers
kneels for "POLICE BRUTALITY"...?WHERE THE F*& IS HE AT WHEN IT COMES TO BLACK ON BLACK CRIME VIOLENCE IN CITIES LIKE CHICAGO!!!?DOES HE KNEEL THEN?DOES ANYONE TALK ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE THEN?hardly. FRAUD!
All of these entitled white people burning brand new Nikes. They had to buy them (giving more $ to Nike) to burn them (), but what strikes me the most, is that brand new shoes are being burned when there are school children wearing shoes with holes in them. Waste.
EVERY dayThere's somethingNEWThat peopleAre mad aboutWhere is yourSHARED HUMANITY
anything to change to narrative so Whypypo dont have to face reality of their own racism. This fake outrage is so beyond ignorant.
Who wants to buy tennis shoes made in Indonesia from slave labor anyway??
Nike products are made in sweatshops in China. They moved all their manufacturing companies out of America, No wonder they side with traitors. Nike has been exploiting black people forever and nothing will ever change that. Kick companies like this out of America.
Yeah, I'm sure Nike is really gonna miss the 70 year old white guy market.
RIP you have slave labor in 45 countries making shoes saluting you symbol and standing for you anthem hypocrite
Hey Im a racist and I need to know what shoes we can wear now, anybody ask ?
I havent seen anybody except white people participating in the
Soooo all the racist rednecks gonna wear converse something?
Have yet to see any expensive items burnedU racist are false flaggin lik shit
is Monday's racist call to arms. I wonder what it will be tomorrow?
Dear Dumb Nike burning poor uneducated white people, President Twitter fingers doesn't respect you, he simply wants your vote.
Are you a racist and a fascist?Are you slithering out of your hate hole? Then welcome to, rage.
I love how white people are saying they won't buy NIKE, but have they told their kids that tho ?
If you hate Nike that much. SEND THAT SHIT TO MENothing says FU-Nike like giving you're old hand me down gear to a black man
Thanks white guys for trying to lower the price of Nikes for Black guys.
if you participating in this bullshit you can eat dick with your racist ass.
Nike Gets and all the WHITE ppl burning your Nikes you get you fucking idiots. Make sure I got some Nike on today.
I love how racists try to regulate what people of color should think and act about racism. Proud of and cant wait to go shopping later today
All Ive worn was for the last 14 years but as of yesterday, I will return to purchasing again. Fuck racist and their . lets take our nation back!
Look at how History judges baseball fans who boycotted Major League Baseball after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.None of these people are remembered.Boycott Nike all you want, but the only person who will be remembered by history is Colin Kaepernick!
like the slave laborers employed by Time for a
until all Americans can afford a pair. Surprised and other athletes who talk about income inequality havent brought up the fact that many cant afford the overpriced sneakers made by children in sweat shops
Is racist yet?
I hope so. Thats where I get my shoes cant wait lol. Pick them up cheap from a racist double the pleasure of wearing them.
Own like the child slaves Nike owns?
its gonna be hella air monarchs at the thrift store this week... cant wait to snag a pair or two. Thanks white people.
So siding with police brutality, racism and false narratives makes sense?!?! You F&%*^ Idiots. Smh.
Lawl, let get this straight, you are a white liberal telling other folks what is racism?For a third-string QB to take a knee during the National Anthem, anyone that disagrees is a racist.Sound logic.
Well, Nike products are expensive and a lot of them are still made out of country by people who get paid pennies in conditions that would make OSHA weep. But theyre not white so youre not going to boycott over that, are you?
You keep on enjoying the products. made by child slaves. Thats a good look
It's being suggested on Twitter that those folks participating in the donate their gear to groups helping underprivileged families. Stop being selfish by burning the items. Donating will also stop the increase in your carbon footprint from fires. Win-win.
Theres nothing heroic about cop killers, antiwhites or millionaire celebrities running as campaigns for sweat shops
If youre upset with you are a racist. Embrace it and stand in your truth!
Watching video proof of racists burning expensive shoes they've already paid for in order to "make the libtards cry" has got my day started with a good laugh. Thanks, !
To those who complain that Nikes are made in sweatshops. Guess where Ivankas and Donalds clothes are made? Try to at least be discreet about your hypocrisy.
Since when have y'all flip flop wearing white ppl start wearing Nike. Have a seat.
Disgrace, unpatriotic and disrespectful. Kaperneck is NO hero.
Since yall burning your Nike products, if you have any Air Huaraches (size 10.5-11), Nike mens windbreaker (medium), that Air Presto x Off-White (10.5-11), and that Travis Scott Air Force 1 Low (10.5-11), DM me. Ill dispose of them for you.
I'm whiteI'm a VetI'm a VFWI'm a DAVHaven't bought Nike merchandise in over 3 years. All this did was reinforce my for your closet racist comment.
buy more products to let these racist know where you stand or kneel it was never about the flag dumbasses
Like the white people were interested in buying products . They may as well stick to a shoe brand that really defines their skin color and racial attitudes, .
Buy more products to let these racist know where you stand or kneel. it was never about the flag dumbasses
stans still pretending their racism is patriotism.
should double down and come out with equality air monarchs. Then name the air monarch the official shoe of kneeling during the anthem. I would buy 12 pairs.
I have nothing to do today than troll all u racist Im here for the pettiness all of it
It was NEVER about oppression! It WAS about a self-indulgent, attention-grabbing move by a spolied, talentless manchild who wasn't good enough to get attention ON the field. When you suck at your job & get benched, throw a fit, Nike will hire you!
... kaepernick's unorganized backyard pickup touch league is more legit than ... those rich white guy owners should be ashamed of themselves...yea i mean you , .......
You cant tell me America isn't racist after this shit....
Of course. Its far more important to 'respect' a piece of cloth and a song then your own beliefs.Stay strong M'erica!P.s; ill take your Nike stuff ya bunch of racists
white folk really mad bout gawddd
im buying some new all white air force ones tomorrow! Boycott Nike? NEVER!
Its not a white verses black thing, its an AMERICAN Pride thing .
You can't afford them anyway you idiot racists
Trump voting racist rednecks will no longer wear Nike gear?? Thats BRILLIANT marketing !
Please DONATE your unwanted gear to the disadvantaged. And while you're at it, how about donating all your gear was well! I'm sure both will be equally appreciated! LOL
The closet racists are coming out wearing torn & burned Nike Tech suits lol
So does this mean nike will have no racist people wearing em no more? I feel like this boycott may be the best thing that ever happened.
Majority for people who are are WHITE PEOPLE. NOT blacks or Hispanics but WHITE PEOPLE. This shows how powerful the white man voice over that of any other race in America. A WHITE man took offense to a BLACK man and the WHITE REPUBLICANS start the attack.
Predictable closet racists and bots in the trend speaking as if they're the only ones who "know veterans". Fam, I know veterans too. They own a wall of boxes and drive Chargers. They love both even more now after today's ad.
New Balance is doing the whitest touchdown dance ever.
BREAKING NEWS: Nike decides to pull Air Monarch shoes from shelves as the rages on. What will white dads wear now? Socks and sandals?
White Americans don't even wear Nikes like that anyway
This really shows you who is racist and who is not
I am honestly ashamed of being white sometimes when I see all the ignorant tweets of some those Nike boycotters
The ad with makes me actually want to buy their merchandise. The is a way for some to hide their racism under the guise of faux patriotism.
Happy to take any size 7.5 ladies air sneakers off you racists. DM me for details.
notice only white people mad at this move by nike
White people fake care so much about veterans, that theyre willing to destroy their clothes instead of donating to these veterans
Anyone participating in this .... Im a size 11. Ill take your racist shoes, and your white supremacy socks..maybe one day youll learn how to be human and humane. But until then...
When a black guy is adopted by white people. Makes millions of dollars in a league created by white people. Then sucks and gets cut after disrespecting the flag and law enforcement and lying about them. Whines and gets sponsored by a company created by white people.
And stop saying people are burning Nike stuff. Say racist whites are burning Nike stuff! Theres a difference from regular people and idiot, racist people
The is silly. The Kap issue has been dead all summer and then football starts and the media revives it. Wake up people... Blacks and Whites... Media continues to fuel racist views in this country. Let's not fall for it over and over
The whites are at it again with the
so many blatant racists participating in this .
PATRIOTISM IS WHITE SUPREMACY
Look at how History judges baseball fans who boycotted Major League Baseball after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.None of these people are remembered.Boycott Nike all you want, but the only person who will be remembered by history is Colin Kaepernick!
Apparently people are attempting a and for some reason Im seeing the phrase white people thrown around a lot but yo, CHILL. Im white and there is absolutely nothing stopping me from buying my 4,456th pair of Nikes.
is LAUGHABLE. gonna make a lot of money off of this. Thanks RACISTS/WHITE SUPREMACISTS! !
Yo, any angry, racist, irrational folks who are about to burn size 4 or S womens Nike workout clothes and/or size 6.5 sneakers in EUC hit me up a Ill take em- win-win
This boycott is so funny. All the legitimate reasons to boycott Nike like enslaving poor brown people for peanuts in their sweatshops hard pass. A printed ad of a person fighting for equality under the law for poor black and brown and its on. Exposed.
Thank everybody who decided to burn their Nike attire. At least we know through their videos, that theyre siding with racism and police brutality
and why doesn't the 27 amendments, and things mentioned in the national anthem not apply to black and brown people? you people are hypocrites. all of this shit is laughable.
Look at how History judges baseball fans who boycotted Major League Baseball after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.None of these people are remembered.Boycott Nike all you want, but the only person who will be remembered by history is Colin Kaepernick!
Racists are burning Nikes instead of crosses. I guess this progress, or something.
lol the racists came out again yal
Funny how the left and Kaepernick think the cops are racist murderers but promote gun laws that would only allow the police to carry firearms.
Literally everyone on the is a racist.
We all know Reebok shoes are the shoes of the discerning white Christian race. I think all REAL white patriotic Americans should go out, but a pile of Nike gear (at a reasonable and competitive price) and set it on fire to show those Hollywood elites how it's done!
still has your money uglies & we will buying extra now since itll be less out of stock. Say thank you Racist!TIME TO BUY MY FAVORITE BRAND OF SHOES! I ALWAYS KNEW NIKE WAS AN INTELLECTUAL!
Nike been getting black people shot for years almost decades
Maybe Nike should set up collection centers for ignorant racist entitled morons can throw away their already purchased items to the homeless vets and children.
Yall burning shit yall already paid for how stupid Remember those racist faces the ones destroying products for no reason other than being ignorant!!Ohh ALSO Fu*k your !!
only shows exactly how many ppl dont give fuck about black being killed by police ...
This proves how dumb white folks are.Privilege makes you stupid.
I guess conservatives are done trashing a POW during his funeral and are now back to pretending it's black people who are the unpatriotic ones.
anyone who is boycotting behind is a RACIST period. If you can't understand why he did what he did and is willing to go to the ultimate extremes in hopes that this man fails in his mission, you're a not a patriot you're a fucking racist
Taking a knee has nothing to do with racism and everything to do with destroying the symbols of our love of country.
Choosing to sign a athlete vs choosing to be racist
like want white trash racist assholes wearing their brand anyway LOL and all the stuff you stupid ignorant people are burning, you already paid for, so well done you!
White nationalist domestic terrorists trumpkin Percocet ridden deplorables have no idea how commerce works. Not surprised...
racist losers your moronic wont make the slightest difference
Instead of destroying your property, why dont you give it away to someone in need?!?There are homeless/poverty stricken people that need shoes. Be better.
Outing the racists and close minded Americans
Wait....first tiger woods now kapperdick. Nike is racist!
If you're feeling so compelled as to dispose of your Nike J's or Off-White's, I'll gladly help you get rid of size 8's. I'm unemployed, after all...
Cops shoot/kill more whites than blacks. Black males are 6-7% of the population but per FBI stats commit 50% of homicides (where race is known) Grand jury evidence proved with physical and testimonial evidence that the hands up dont shoot meme was based on a lie.
I don't get white people who are okay with police who execute unarmed citizens in the street including children like Tamir Rice. There's something wrong with y'all.
White ppl love burning shit. Nike gear, crosses, whatevs.
is a joke of a company now showing its true cop hating colors.
The people wearing Nike are not - for the most part - old, white, conservative men. will not work. Colin Kaepernick took a stand and paid a great price personally.
So white people are mad about this today
The only people boycotting Nike are racist Amerikkka...
The great thing about these crazies doing is that I don't have to worry about twinning with a racist who thinks Police should be able to gun down blacks at will.
Let's see what other pieces of personal property we can get conservative whites to destroy!
Bunch of racist ppl are doing this but all we are asking for is equality
sums up the history of America. A group who is being tortured, killed, and violated in every way imaginable asks simply to be left alone and the racists and privileged bring the fire and violence.
White people boycotting a brand they put the least dollars in? had to read why
You know somethings a problem when there are no people of color participating in the
To those who complain that Nikes are made in sweatshops. Guess where Ivankas clothes are made? Try to at least discreet about your hypocrisy.
I dont understand this . So people are siding with police brutality and racism?? Woof.
racism will not win!!!
Like actually the only thing yall are proving is that youre okay with black people or POC being killed and humiliated. If you dont know what Kaepernic kneels for then you DO NOT need to be a part of the
is so stupid. Kap will be the Muhammad Ali of his generation...loathed by white people in his time, lighting the Olympic Torch in his old age.
white people have the hardest time admitting to doing something wrong. you people truly are inferior.
This is revealing a lot of the closet racists
Don't burn your sneakers. Donate them to poor or underprivileged children.
Things white people wont boycott 1. The NFL2. H&M3. DOVE4. The U.S government 5. The NRA6. The federal reserve 7. HollywoodAll of the aforementioned institutions have proven to be anti black & even anti American but leave it to whites to boycott a damn sign
Thanks Nike, expose the racists in 3, 2, 1.....
yes please take yall off white prestos back to the store so I can purchase them. Please. I beg you.
All the racist showing face w The .. we see you!!!. Donate those bad boys, we apprecuate and your generosity:)
Y'all people make me sick. WTF. Racists hiding for years. Suddenly, you fucks coming out of your skeleton-filled closets calling people baboons and monkeys & voting for white nationalists. Then take off your Nikes. Go to the gym quo with your skid row souls
Watching all my white friendships burn with their shoes.. this is why you never quit!
Fuck this racist ass ....all these racist white people
in a nutshell: Kap-I dont like racial prejudice, Reps-I dont like your tone, Nike-we like that you stayed committed and stood up for morality even under persecution, Reps-Im going to go destroy a bunch of imported goods and complain about economics
The people who are destroying their property are the problem: privilege much?! This is exactly the issue at heart. Not the flag, not the military. Once again missing the point. Showing cutting your Nikes is idiotic when so many kids would cry to have those shoes.
Kapernicks not the one who believes in something even if it means sacrificing everything our soldiers are. Nike is a disgrace
Burning is not a political statement. It is a symbolic proxy . If you burn your Nikes, you dont love America. You hate black people.
as if we didn't know the was racistthey had to punctuate their hate
Looking forward to seeing all the racist scum engage in their - Should be fun times to mock them until they cry.
what are crazy racists going to wearwhen they don't go to Hamiltonand not drink keurig
I'm looking to fetch a pair of Air Max 97 size 8. Any color will do.
it was never about the flagwhich means it is not about the flagwhen is the trump base going to admitthey are racists... ?
yall white folk tripping tripping
All these white ppl be mad like a mf wen kaepernick make big moves

All the racist and but hurt white folk with the Thank you all for Making America Great Again
This has to be the most dumbest thing I ever heard of... Anyone participating in this is a racist plain and simple
Wanna see a buch of racist white ppl? Click
Yo send me a pair of Black On Black Airmaxes and embroid BLM on the laces for ya boy. Thanks.
Someone give Kaep a gun so triggered White folks can boycott those too
Why do white people always have to burn things down when they are unhappy? Why can't they make their complaints through the formal channels? And they expect nice things!
Hey cis White folks:TRIGGERED
The campaign that racists have been waiting to get behind, the appointment of as the face of the campaign, is so wonderfully accompanied by said racists setting their Nike gear on fire that its a thing of beauty. Racist: torch thyself.
If is the champion of urban youth why do they market towards inner city kids but put a white collar price on the box? You and have directly increased crime in the inner city..
bro people burnin anything with a swoosh on it.. or cuttin that logo straight off the apparel lmfao. it's the dumbest shit i've seen next to white people hurling their keurigs off their balcony.
If anyone wants to sell me their Nike shoes after this outrage DM me, off whites especially any size
Wayment. Y'all so racist you willing to destroy or trash perfectly good clothes?
Nothing like a racist walking around with no shoes on. Theyll be easier to spot atleast
They should next hire the disgraced to really boost the brand.
Im from , birthplace of . Never thought Id see a jerk like  become part of its marketing. Disgraceful. Theres a ++ solution: . Dont buy  products unless hes axed now!
If anyone has a pair of black or navy blue low top mens size 13 AF1s and are joining in the , donate them to me. I want a good early birthday present for my brother.
I can't with y'all and & and this . Sheer craziness. Props and power for your strength, courage & grace under fire. God bless you, brother. You are doing what you were put on this earth to do. Stand tall & strong. I'm out
Why do liberals make everything about race? Sorry, you no longer get to try to guilt or shame people with your race baiting retweet.
Wish I was able to stay awake to see response to and their work with .I guarantee his bash will be racists, classist and riddled with dog whistles...Someone record it for me.
Racists are so uncultured and retarded.
This pic. breaks down so that fake patriots (that KNOW the issue is about police brutality, & systematic racism, but want to keep the 'baboons' in their place) can understand, but...will claim ignorance, & instead tell them to shut up, & dribble...
., you took the side of a racist cop hater who disrespects the National anthem. This will do for you what it did for the , which nobody watches any more.
