Have you ever had a strong conviction that a stock was headed for a substantial drop, and wished to profit from its decline? I wonder if any of the friends of made money since "They" Knew this was going to happen?

When did start making KneePads?

Hey you see the fear in his eyes?Hes gonna die soon, and he knows it, yet he continues up those stairs.Pathetic Little hasnt got a clue what that is like.STFU
No more
Tim Tebow took a knee in prayer before every game and was mocked for it, then told he couldnt write Bible verses on his face paint. Where was on that? Silent. But Kaepernick can wear socks saying cops are pigs. The cops who protect him should take a knee.
Dont forget everyone, when you dump , do NOT switch to or as they are owned by the as well.
Ouch. But, where did they see this being a good idea to begin with?Does still believe, after the markets closed today?
HA!Hhhaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahaha <gasp> hahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaa
So youre not going to wear Nikes on your feet. But youre going to wear your favorite player jersey this weekend. . Enjoy your stupidity.
Ordering as many products as I can afford. History will look on you kindly If those burning their nike products could donate them to charity instead that'd be great

He sacrificed what, his job, millions???? Ok, then let the man sleep in his own bed, live with his decision, position. His beef is he wants the money too. Sorry mr brave man, it dont work that way.

Good reasons for a 1: Size 13 fits like 112: Shoes look tacky af3: They're the king of child labor & sweatshopsBad reasons for a 1: Don't like the ads
I understand people are upset about the whole & thing but don't burn or throw away your shoes. There are people walking the street that can afford shoes. So how about & donate your shoes.

Nike shares fell Tues after company revealed new ad campaign featuring Kaepernick. Marketing campaign sparked backlash from some consumers on social media. was trending on Twitter, with sme ppl saying were going to burn their Nike sneakers.
if you want to burn or destroy your nike gear, consider donating your stuff instead. im sure there are kids or other people who would love & would be grateful to have your nike stuff!
Well done!
If youre Mad at and youre burning your products, youre a full blown re welcome, Now you know.
I hope they lose more.
looks like my 2 sons won't have to worry about getting new nike gear for basketball and baseball this year you should be more careful about the horse you hook your wagon to.
What Kaepernick did was wrong. What Nike is doing now is wrong.

√â "quem lacra n√£o lucra" que diz?
Yay for Nike! Imgoing to buy a pair this weekend!
This is so awesome!
I have archived keyword "Kaepernick" since May 2018, which has about 1.8 M tweets. About 1.1 million of those are from after the Nike announcement & 10,569 of those have the in them. DM & I can try to get you a csv of them, if needed.

Je ne comprend pas tout ce chahut √† propos de la nouvelle campagne de pub de Nike mettant en vedette Copernic. Avec lui √† bord, the sky is the limit!


I think this sums it up.
Neither Nike or Kaepernick have a clue what real sacrifice is.
Still laughing so hard at people burning their shit.


To all the reactionary asshats burning your gear, there are plenty of less fortunate folks who need shoes, shirts, etc., and dont have the luxury or burning clothes for the sake of a political statement. Make your matter for someone.
After watching professional football for over 50 years, I gave it up 2 years ago, now, no more Nike!
When I see idiots destroying items theyve already paid for.



My Nikes were extra comfortable today
I will not be buying Nike.
Current mood in . .
Most definitely. I might even have promoted people buying if this were the case. But they chose to cave...
anybody size 8.5 to 9 go head toss them shoes my way
What if you took all the Nike clothing youre about to cut up and donate it to people that dont have any??
Woah! is trending!

Hey people grow up


Im digging the new Nike Campaign!! Thanos has more snaps in 2018 than Kaepernick will have!!


People that dont want their Nikes anymore should give them to Goodwill instead of burning them. There are people out there who cant afford shoes
If you don't like your apparel don't burn it! Donate it to people who need it. Try to make a difference in a good way. There are millions around the world who would die to have a piece of cloth to wear
I will be boycotting big and rich. Thanks
Im so late on this thing ...can someone fill me in?
With this goin on, I might be able to find my Size 14s at the store now! No more online ordering.
if anyone has any size 11 shoes they need help destroying hmu
Honestly I dont think Kaepernick should even go back to the NFL Hes too good for that... Seems like he has another calling now

Too good...

Yall need to chill. Nike chose to endorse Kap bc of his work ethic & either way yall be butthurt over the smallest things. is for children change my mind.

This new Caepernick campaign would be laughable if it didn't give me a pit in my stomach. What does this loser know about sacrifice? Can someone tell me that?

Everyone burning their shitty Nikes they mow the lawn in, meanwhile Bron has a Lion on his new shoes
I need a new favorite ball cap. Ideas? My hat will be meeting an untimely demise when I can find the time to deal with it appropriately.
When you burn all your stuff ,Not realizing you didn't go shopping beforehand.
Nike stock down nearly 3 percent in afternoon trading as was trending on Twitter. A short-term blip that was totally worth it! Going to buy all new gear this weekend.
This got me thinking and I gotta say, it would be pretty cool to see people wearing shirt with my name
I looked at the stock market and can see that wont impact the long term value of the brand or its stock. Like Kureg and Starbucks, Nike will outlast Why? POC have been driving Nike sales since Jordan!
When people started ripping up their Nike shoes & socks... I felt that!
Well OK Nike, if you say so!!Had to change my Twitter profile cover pic
You need people like me so you can point your fingers and say, 'That's the bad guy.'
When reached for comment about and the Michael Jordan said, "Yeah, that's a thing that happened."
If anybody has a pair of LeBrons size 13 ill make sure they get destroyed for you hmu

Nikes really going to miss the 30 big ones they get from rednecks and Young Conservatives at the outlet mall every three years.


Keep the pressure on 3.16% drop is good but we need to get them to really hurt.

Kinda like how 13 year old Katie Johnson had to sacrifice her life after Trump raped her at Trump's best buddy, convicted pedo Jeffrey Epstein's sex party.
Crisp and spicy

Take a stand for something, when the one thing youre good at isnt enough to be pro anymore.
Loving the conservative snowflakes who are fucking up their . Funniest shit ever!
If you dont like Nike now for whatever reason thats on you. Its your opinion, whatever. But instead of ruining your nice clothes, shoes, socks, etc. why not try donating them? Seems like a good idea to me.
Well, thanks Nike, my decision is now made. Salomon trail shoes for me!

Dds discount and factory 2 u is the only place thats gon take a hit durin this
Perhaps and need to be reminded what real sacrifice is.

Folks really out here burning Nike apparel...did you forget you paid for that stuff. So, in essence youre out here looking like boo-boo-the-fool.
There's nothing more Republican than burning your own shoes to boycott them after you already bought them instead of giving them to homeless people who need them

I won't miss my Nikes. Weren't all that anyway. My Puma's are much better. Goodbye
Pretty much sums it up...

Nike does not care if you burn the junk you already have that is bought and paid for. They got their money! It's whether or not you buy from them in the future that matters, People.

you will NEVER see a pair of these tennis shoes on me or in my closet again!!!!
Boycotting ? Check that cheek contour, sis.
FUCK NIKE CHILD LABOR NEEDS TO BE STOPPED

Perhaps, folks shouldnt wrap their identities up with professional athletes or teams.

Good luck with your endorsement of Kapernick. I will never buy another Nike product. Your venture into politics was without thought, or really stupid. Either way, you guys blew it.
conservatives dump Nike only when Kapernick becomes the front man. Before that they were all about buying shoes made overseas in asian sweatshops. go figure.

This is me when I search . If you need a good laugh, click on that .
pointless, they are a global brand. Well done

BYE
Oh, come on, people. Maybe donate your shoes and clothes to people who need them if you dont want them. Instead of, like, burning them.

bring them down to their knees, keep the boycott going!
Not sure who created this, but it is gold.
Womp
how foolish of Nike for choosing such a petulant child to associate with. They were my fav brand and that of my college age child - not any more.... bye!

OMG ...LMFAO!!!
Can we take the back a couple of decades?

If any of you liberals out there are able to read, READ this article. I doubt any of you will have the balls to do it.....

I can assure you no Democrats are burning their shoes tonight, theyre kneeling in front of them.
Wow probably the worst deal you could have made. This child dont even play football anymore! that's ok Adidas is better anyway!

everyone participating in the , yall forreal look stupid as hell. Burning your shit like you think its actually gonna do something. All youre doing is wasting your own money
Boom!! Here it is!!
All out of crosses I see
This is pure idiocy.
If ur doing the bcuz of principles thats fine but I ask that you take your Nike items to a homeless shelter & donate them rather than burn/cut them up. Poor people dont always have the luxury of things you take for granted like what brand of shoes you wear.
Y'all burning them that look like New Balance
Imagine if everyone mad at Nike decided to donate their Nike shoes & apparel to the needy & less fortunate. That would be a good day in the world. Wish there was still some good in this world.
before you go all jersey burning and condemning where were you when they were exploiting third world workers to create their gear?

With the state of Capitol Hill in such disarray, I'm still glad people don't boycott voting (although they'd have good reason to).
wow i'm quitting my job and dedicating my life to foraging dumps to find these shoes and THEN GIVE THEM TO THE TROOPS
Does cutting off the logo from any article of clothing or shoe make it not Nike anymore? Does it transform into another brand?
tries to pull an but pulls an I stupid instead!
donate, don't destroy, you idiots. Ppl need those Nike clothes!
 
, not watching NFL was tough for this football fanatic bu it will be real easy to not buy Nike products. Other products can replace easily.

But you already paid for your Nike shoes tho....so by burning them you are hurting........yourself? Am I missing something? or have some people gone to new levels of stupidity?
When you want to burn your Nikes but realize the only pair you own is the $2000 pair of Back to the Future Nikes.
What happens when everyone who burned their Nike gear buy it all back in 2 weeks??
shares are down 3.16% today. Seems like the boycott is starting to effect the market valuation of the company.
The idea behind a boycott is to stop buying a product -- not to destroy a product you already bought with your own money. Torching your own property is weird and pointless.

Lets see what did he sacrifice. Oh yeah nothing since you have been paying him for years.

One good thing about this is now maybe I can find my size in the style shoes I want! Upside to everything I guess
How about donating your gear to a homeless shelter, womens shelter, schools in need, or an orphanage instead of lighting a fire potentially putting peoples lives at risk? Nike already has your money dummies

Instead of lighting your already paid for shoes on fire, donate the shoes and light yourself on fire. It's a win, win.

So, you have products that you want to sell to People. People come from all walks of life and beliefs. Common sense teaches you that you want ALL People to buy the product you created. And then you come up with this brilliant idea. Let's alienate millions of People.
If 43% of Nike's revenue is from U.S., losing "only" 10% to a will cost Nike 4.3% in reduced revenue.That's a lot to any company selling optional-purchase items in an economy very short of middle-class jobs now.

Shame on Nike and Kaepernick Im gonna burn it all.

I hope Nike believes in its own campaign and its willing to risk "everything" themselves as Kaepernick has done.
By taking Nikes money, Kaepernicks made it clear he wont salute the flag, but he will bow down to the dollar. I cant wait until the shareholder file suit. 3billion more loss Nike

Nope, you're wrong. They're actually crying. The major thing an intl company cares about besides profit is it's public image. Everybody has an idea that something is wrong with Nike whether they understand why or not! I can hear the sobbing all the way over here.

I'd ask what his old friend Cowboy Troy thinks of Kaepernick and the dumbass , but knowing Rich, he only counts Troy's opinion for 3/5th of what it's worth (if he gives Troy a vote at all).

I wish ppl who claim to be doing this would have a tall glass of
NO!

The new spokesperson!!

The is as dumb as the Chickfil-a boycott... what a bunch of dumb fucks
When heard about the :
If you wanna join the all I ask Is you donate your Nike apparel to families or children in need; you are not doing any damage to Nike by burning or defacing a product you have already paid for. Simply donate and stop buying their brand.

I consider myself conservative and Ill be damned if I politicize the shoes I wear. I wear what I like dont give a shit
Possibly the dumbest thing .. its make more sense to boycott Jordan's but most of these people prefer to avoid logic when it comes to their beliefs
Oh, and I wear a Small and 6.5

Something tells me that the people destroying their products, or buying them for the sole purpose of destroying them, dont necessarily understand the way boycotts are supposed to work

I will not buy any products until it removes Colin Kaepernick and
Okay, you're pissed, I get it. But instead of burning & destroying perfectly good clothes, why not donate them to a homeless shelter, or a charity that can actually do some good with them. It's not like Nike doesn't already have your money.
We dont give a shit about yall boycotting!!! Im about to go buy a full Nike warmup outfit with the headband!!!

does anyone actually burning their Nikes know what a boycott is?

Wishful thinking. It won't happen
Regardless of how you feel about the I think we can all agree we should listen to the side that hasn't set their shoes on fire while still wearing them
Boycott Nike like yall boycotted Star Wars. It totes works.
We have our new weekly boycotting! congratulations Nike for whatever you didIve already boycotted boycotting so therefore, I can no longer boycott things.

I'd boycott food rather than Nike. Nikey is life
quick note if you're burning your shoes it means Nike already received your money for them so the "money lost" is on your end, not theirs k cool
the kneeling never had anything to do with verterans. Now, you are cutting up clothing that could assist the impoverished. You are also alienating people that may simply like Nike or have nothing else to wear.
I will NEVER buy another Nike product!! You should be ashamed to put his face with your brand.

A step down is often preparation for a step up. . Never sacrifice destiny for money.

Its not whether you agree with 's views or not ( I dont). It's about Nike's shareholders & the company deciding to get politically involved which is a poor biz decision. Sell your shares to lock in any profits & buy back in down the road.

Pat Tillman sacrificed everything, has-been and rich Kaepernick has sacrificed nothing!
A few thoughts on : If you're planning to burn your Nike gear, might I suggest donating those items to a shelter or clothing bank instead? I can refer you to some if you're local (Meridian, MS).
So...The thing that makes me laugh the most about idiots burning is the fact that if they donated their Nike products, they would be more likely to help the unfortunate and hurt the company.It's such a great metaphor for the RWNJ mentality.

Nike doesnt care that you are burning shoes which they have already collected YOUR money from. Idiots
What % of the people boycotting Nike never wore Nike in the first place?

Ill be buying Adidas and Under Armour now.
Nike sucks!
If anyone trying to get rid of their Nikes I wear a size 10
Whos actually winning Nike or people who buy Nike to burn them or cut them?
is fine
What exactly is Kaepernick sacrificing, sitting on the bench? Pretty sure he's being compensated pretty well by Nike, so . . .
I will no longer buy a products due to them having a hate monger as their spokes person!

Burning Man.
Since theres alot of pretend patirots out there.....

2014 season. June 4, Kaepernick signed a six-year contract extension with the 49ers, worth up to $126 million, including $54 million in potential guarantees, and $13 million fully guaranteed.Nike's Indonesian sweatshop workers make 1.25 per hour and live in slums.
Dont burn your Nikes! Give them to people who would be grateful to have shoes. Send them Ill give them away.

is silly, and it's Checks over stripes. That's what PLG likes.
Going to buy some new Nike shoeeeessss today all thanks to the lmao
DIY Inspiration
Stock prices rise and fall, but Nike is too big to fail. For each person who stops buying Nike, there will be a person who thinks that buying Nike gear puts him/her on par with Dr. King and Malcolm X, like the great Kaepernick.
Much love

How do you get the Nike etching off a shot glass?

There is a whole lot of sickness out there.

Yo 'ers.... Tough break... There's always FUBU
Dont burn your Nikes. Give them to me. I will gladly wear them

Bye, you might be cute but clearly you have no brains. Sorry, I don't have a firepit but I'm sure Goodwill is more accepting then I am!
What goes around comes around. Nike banned and now the World is banning

Hey I think you screwed up more than you can possibly imagine - this will never be forgotten
These shoes are looking pretty shabby. I think Ill buy some new Nikes after work.
OH SHIZNIT! I forgot to mention that I will burn them and definitely not wear them. Nope. I will definitely not wear them at all. Btw I prefer the shoe size to be 11.5.

All the crazies are out. Colin Kapernick, the flag, and a supreme court hearing are the talk around the digital water cooler.
The din of is deafening...It would appear, upon further review...that is intended to be euphemistic w/ and the like.
Nike is one of the most iconic brands worldwide but yeah a Kaepernick ad will destroy them
Wayment people think they can really cancel Nike ???? The nerve ...
Nike sucks, I'd rather walk barefoot.

Ive never been more proud to be a Nike boy than I am today

So much talk about the . All I can say is... Youll catch me wearing my Nikes way more often .
This whole is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. They already have your money? What are you accomplishing?
Please keep this a secret.
We found replacements for your boycottted Jordans.
These are super nice and so cheap!!

Before you burn your nikes Ill take them for you. Air max, Jordans, if it has the swoosh Ill wear the shit out them. Size 11. Even pay for the shipping.
Nike's going down!!
Me walking into the first mall I see to buy the shirts with the biggest emblems on the front

Soooo does this mean I may have a chance getting shoes in my size now?
Enough said
So this is how the 2020s play out - Kanye runs for president in 2024 in Yeezys for the Republicans, up against 's Mark Parker for the Dems. Finally politics is decided on footwear preference as it should be.


Who even watches or reads the ads? I buy whatever is on sale at the time or comfy. Could be Nike, could be something else. My wallet dictates what I buy. Not who is chosen for an ad campaign.

Was planning on getting these bad boys but not after Nikes recent events.

I till say:

I love nike never boycott

Nike will lose nothing from this, it's a commercial decision. Keep burning stuff, tho, it's funny and some of you might forget to take it off first
If y'all people have any size 11s on you I'll gladly take them off your hands
Now that made that commercial, I gotta throw all my sneaks away...

I've never wanted to buy Nikes before now; what pair should I grab?
I love it! Burn those running shoes you bought but NEVER RUN IN!
Got to love the , people spending hundreds of dollars on Nike merchandise then destroying it on video, that sound you hear is profits going up as the money in these peoples wallets go down
I'm going to buy Nike instead of a .....There now it's in your notifications too.
Instead of burning you clothes and cutting them up why not donate them to the less fortunate


the fact their products are made in a sweatshop is more than reason enough to boycott Nike. YouTube Nike Sweatshop.
Sadly, does not believe in Chicago even if it means sacrificing everything!
People are really destroying their clothes that they ALREADY bought like its going to affect Nike... but go off
Someone had to tell him...
All those people trying to start a should start their own brand of sneakers and call them Nizees.

Question for anyone burning their Nikes over Colin Kaepernick: So you were ok with sweatshops and children making them but Kaepernick was the deal breaker?

How does burning Nike products hurt Nike? You already bought the damn thing...Ooo I get it! Its about the principle! I got you

In Indonesia, Nike factories routinely dispose of rubber soles in the open and simply burn them, exposing children to carcinogens and other toxins.This is what Kaepernick and his new BFF, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stand for.



I'm staying with thank you very much I ain't burning shit


Shout out to all morons burning their stuff, please donate it to local shelters schools, etc.

Going out for some new duds!!
This is much better than Colin Kaepernick!
Clearly hasnt watched what happened to the NFL, or is the marketing department at Nike that stupid? Seems like they may have had dumb luck up to this point to have a successful brand. Watch what happens now!!!
If anyone finna burn their nike prestos, ima size 10, shoot em my way & Ill take care of them for you.

The is su funny. You do realize that burning something you already bought doesnt actually take the money out of s account?

For the record, if you are burning shoes while people around the world would die for a pair of shoes, you are an idiot.

Y'all guys are on this wave and I am still dreaming about those Air sneakers. Life mwattu!

Ok. You all have done it. The only thing more asinine than destroying your own shit with a is involving Pat Tillman in this. If you knew ANYTHING about Pat, you'd know he'd kneel with Kaepernick.

I could never see paying overprice for shoes and sports wear, I like my cheap yoga pants and Addias

What if Nike purposefully put Colin in the ads fully knowing that their stock would fall so the executives could buy up more, then they get rid of him and stock value rises again and the execs personally make millions.

I play the reverse card. Your turn.

To everyone burning theyre s listen up. You can sendem to me. Size 11 but I can make 10s work too. I mean at least donate them to someone that needs ‚Äòem. How many people still go to Target that swore they never would again? Ill wait....

People are burning their shoes! When you dumped Tiger we didn't get it, but?
These people might as well have showed themselves burning money. Nike already got the sale from them, what do they care if their product is destroyed after the fact? Wish there was a cure for stupidity will not see a tragic drop in profit.
Lol!

Donate your apparel you chuds. FFS, theres plenty of people with nothing, and a donation of clothing before cold weather starts would mean a lot. More than having a baby wah wah fit over social media would.

Gone throw out your Nike. Burn it. We don't care. I'm going to Nike Town very soon.
I would but I don't own any of their overpriced sweatshop produced crap. However, it may be time to buy some stock



So the brand pissed you off...How about instead of destroying it. How about donating it to the needy... people

Regardless of what side you take on the anthem kneeling situation, it saddens me to know that people would rather burn merchandise (which Nike has already profited off of) than donate it to an organization that could help someone in need of clothing or shoes.

Kavanaugh Donate : Beyonce

I own one pair of Nikes but, now I shall wear them proudly.

Did you see the one where the guy cut the swoosh off socks he had already bought?

After you Trumptarts are done with the please boycott oxygen...Thanks

Make sure you share your results! You typically dont share results when the majority takes Trumps side or believe standing for the anthem should be required - so figure the way this is going, you wouldnt share either.

I'm so excited, Nikes are gonna be so easy to purchase on SNKRS since these emotional idiots are doing this ish.

If you destroy your own Nike gear for this You're only playing yourself. Disagree with their marketing campaign or not, you paid good money for that shit bruh!

is nothing more than a continuation of two groups not understanding their own issues.

Y'all can burn all y'all Nike if you wanna. Kaep gon make Ms regardless!

foolish to assume all millennials are excited for Nike and kaepernick teaming up. Nike will be get burned from this one.

Everything being burned in this looks like high end New Balance gear.Nike was really putting on for the suburban stepdads

is not the bad guy 1st an for most, an why are you guys burning what are you gaining from this ???

Hey we fixed it for you! 'Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything!'
Also signed on I cant wait til the drive their trucks off a cliff.

But yall already paid for the apperal that you're cutting up or burning .

If you I insist in participating in this nonsense, at least do this.

While yall are in the mood to burn and boycott dont forget your Converse...they are wholly-owned by Nike as well.
I swear if this brings all these Chads to start rocking Reebok classics, Im going to be tight.

The whole goes to show that stupid people will get upset over anything and feel the need to be heard.
Still not burning my Nikes
I was an avid Nike lover but I will NEVER purchase or wear your products again!!!
I'm going to make a prediction that stocks fall fast. People are burning their Nikes. Liberals sure know how to manufacture outrage often times hurting themselves. There's an old saying "you reap what you sow".
The people are gonna start burning eyebrows soon
Nope, but we buy their product. Not anymore !!! My boys are football, baseball, basketball , wrestling and track athletes. They all wear gear, after school today we are off to buy ....
please, like those inbred, confederate flag waving, food stamp selling hillbillies could afford Nike shoes in the first place.
Ive ALWAYS been an Adidas girl. Always. But Im going out to get some gear today. Considering that I spend most of my life in athletic gear now, this should be fun.
Looks like Adidas and Under Armour are my new favorite stores.
Was happy when my daughter asked if her Nikes matched her outfit today. Yes, yes they do!
is stupid. Burning or cutting up your own stuff. You know already has your money. Besides that, I haven't seen one person burn a pair of Jordans yet. Those are Nike shoes too you know. Going to me some today.
I don't wear Nike, but find the to be odd. You buy Nike shoes. Burn Nike shoes. But can't ask for refund as you burnt them. And Nike has your money! Also, may be worth finding out WHY Kaepernick started kneeling, before getting angry...


If comes out with a sneaker with flames on the sides I will absolutely lose my shit.

Been meaning to buy new kicks for a few weeks already but life kept getting in the way. Now I understand why! Bravo !!! Thanks for the inspiration and setting such a great example! ???
Hi, basic marketing here. Publicizing your "boycott" and getting trending is literally what fuels a viral campaign like this and only gives more visibility. But please, continue.
Got on Nike shoes today. Rarely wear the pair I have but these days I guess shoes can be a statement. While I don't follow sports, I appreciate what Kaepernick has done/is doing. That is more important to me than who wins a game.

1 of 2For all of those who are ignorant to our flag code, let me enlighten you. Interesting how the ones most outraged are often the biggest offenders.

Why can't they get control of that stupid B**** screaming and holloring at the confirmation hearing???? WTH Get her OUT!!

For those of you who are dumb enough to think Nike will tank, you clearly have no clue how much this brand is worth. This isn't the early 30s dummies...most of your other favorite companies endorse and are backed by Nike stock. Read a paper
LOL.DUMBASS PEOPLE. Destroying Nike gear by cutting it up and setting it on fire. If you're that dead set on being CLUELESS,give it to a homeless person or a person who can't afford it,stupid.
I'm going to take a wild guess and assume that Nike's main target market isn't middle-aged conservatives. So y'all have fun with your lil -- I doubt it'll really make that much of a difference.

Am I too late to by setting a pair of $200 sneakers on fire... or nah?

What has Nike the NFL and the athletes kneeling during the national anthem done for the fatherless children in Chicago, I truly dont know this is an honest question,

I'm rarely proud to be associated with a major, billion-dollar corporation, or a company that for all the social good it tries to do has incredible flaws in its practice. Today, I'm damn proud to be a Nike guy.
Facts: Most of you boycotting arent able to afford real Nikes anyway. All of the videos have been old, raggedy, & cheap shit. Burn your Air Max or Vapor Max & Ill believe you!


Any of y'all size 13 kobe/Jordan joints don't burn that shit send it my way
Most of these idiots burning their Nike's don't appear to have ever actually exercised a day in their life


If really wants to be bold and promote someone who speaks the truth without fear, they should look no further than Rev. Jasper Williams Jr. for his brave and honest speech.

Instead of destroying your nike clothes then putting pictures online to grandstand, donate them to goodwill or something
We should all buy official stickers, put them on new propane bottles and shoot them at close range with high powered rifles to own the libs.

if you don't want your gear DM me. I'm large all across the board lbs


Congratulations to for being named the new spokesperson for oxygen. Clean, breathable air is so important. I hope no one misinterprets the reason he started kneeling during the anthem and decides to boycott air...

Destroying products don't hurt a company AT ALL during a boycott. Sell it on Ebay/Craigslist/Facebook, ect and flood the market with low priced Nike gear so that the demand of their high priced stuff drops. THAT hurts, not burning. Please Retweet this.
guess you never heard of Pat Tillman. He sacrificed everything!

Hey Oh! Who'da thunk it?

There's no way can say they didn't see this coming. Will they now be putting their swoosh and these socks?

At the end of the day, Nike will be seen in a progressive light others should follow. They will be making $$$$$ off of Kaepernick and his message. This $ in turn is fueling a company, CEO, and investors that put $ towards laws, lobbying, and politicians.

Yo deadass, If anybody is even thinking about boycotting Nike by burning your shoes, send them Hyperdunks this way. Size 11.5. I dont get you people.

I cant wait to buy some gear and watch the snowflakes melt. I think I am on to an new slogan!

Did they burn their sports jerseys too? Nike made most of them....


Lol Nike already has your money yet you are over here catching feelings destroying your clothes. Yeah thats really standing up for something!
people really think that destroying Nike products that they ALREADY BOUGHT AND PAID FOR is going to ruin the company. lol
I have like 25 pairs of Nikes. Well I did until about an hr ago. That was the dumbest thing that Nike could have done.

Imagine thinking youre sticking it to a company by destroying a product youve already spent money on.
I will say this about the , I can't wait for to hear what and have to say about it.
Well officially team

Anyways, this lil bad ting here will be going shopping for MORE since I love them even more now.
I can guarantee you that the demographic burning their Nike items aren't even apart of the company's primary target market. Therefore, they don't matter in the grand scheme of things.

No for me!
This is my favorite tweet on the situation

There are more important issues to get behind than this one >>> Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.  My mother taught me never to follow the crowd - if they jumped off a cliff, everyone who followed would too.

I have not owned any sneakers in over 5 years but will be buying some Nikes this week!
LOL this is some funny stuff and so ignorant...destroying stuff you own is not a boycott...

Lol
Bwahahaha its working!!
Let's be honest.....most of these clowns that wanna boycott Nike have never owned a pair in their life!! I've seen their attire
( in the meantime, is trending globally )
Lol at this Destroying shit that you ALREADY paid for IS NOT a boycott, its a hissyfit.


Burning your Nike gear doesn't hurt Nike. Donating your Nike gear doesn't help Nike. If you're going to boycott a brand, at least take the route that isn't wasteful and childish.

Haven't bought Nikes in years. Getting a pair today. We love a good marketing strategy
This is what Nike should have done


fam hasnt purchased for a long time. If youre going to boycott Nike great-Id urge you not to burn shoes but instead donate them to an org that sends them to 3rd world countries where shoes mean the difference between life/death.
The motive behind is no different than and we know what that was all about.
move by is big F YOU to . Let's say say F YOU back.
My favorite jogging shoes , another reason to purchase more

no way . more nike I love nike
Bye bye Nike!

I feel sorry for the man - hes not the sharpest tool in the shed!And he burned himself - Lordy Lordy Lordy
Thank you , I had really missed hearing about Colin Kap, kneeling, and more politicalization of Football. Great way to start the year!
Chuck Taylor himself could come back from the dead and punch my mother in the face and I still wouldn't burn my shoes. Idiots.
Lol fuck yall, that man didnt do anything wrong. Keep burning your shit, Nike has already been paid, youre wasting your own money dumb ass.

All those ppl are going to go out and buy different brands now and thatll further erode Nikes market share. Nike loses again
What is this new shoe, Boycott, that Nike made? Where can I get some?

So people really out here burning gear that they already spent their money on? OK sis
It's a fake issue.
It doesn't make sense for anyone to destroy something they bought with hard earned money.
shot themselves in the shoe. Saying a washed-up QB sacrificed everything for what he believed, kneeling before the flag that NFL player Pat Tillman gave his life. That is sacrificing everything. will cost them lost sales. Have to sell NKE(opinion)

I love Kap and all the good he has done, and applaud this decision. Iranians, however, will not forget how you pulled a bitch move and wouldnt provide cleats to our boys during the World Cup.

Yall deadass burning your expensive ass shoes and socks and shit that you ALREADY gave your money to Nike on. They laughing at you dumbasses
I own four pairs. I might wear them all today!
So unless you plan to walk around naked and barefoot, its going to be hard to find a brand that is not in someway connected on the issue.
This is what you call instant karma! Participating in the as a message burns his Nike shoes while wearing them. This is stupidity!
Im a size 13 in shoe and L in clothing. I take all donations.
So what exactly is the supposed to prove? Nike dont care if you burn their products, they already got your coins

loving Kaepernick's lashes
If you're going to burn your Nikes, take em off your feet first!
Hey ...honestly I have never thought of buying your shoes. Normally a man myself. But thanks to your Kaepernick campaign, I think I'm going to go see how a pair of Nike's fit these big ol' feet lol. is pathetic.
PSA: I will take your Nike SBs, Nike Dunks and Huaraches from ya if youre salty about the Kap commercial, size 11 pls
GOOD FOR NIKE!!!!!!!!!! I'm going to buy more Nike now!!!!! LOTS MORE!!!!

Im about to buy some nike shit rn
Wait! What exactly did Kapersh!t sacrafice, he can still get a real J.O.B.
why are people burning their nike products as if they havent already paid for them, you think nike cares? you already gave them your money lol
For every Nike product you Kap haters burn, we will buy five. And by the way, you already paid for them. If you wanted to really do something positive with your misplaced anger, donate them to youth sports.
most of the people boycotting Nike don't own pair. More fake outrage. Kind of like how they're mad about emails but didn't know what emails was short for or didn't even have an email lolol
Me this morning sitting in front of the computer buying Nike shoes. My kids have no idea what's gotten into me.
After seeing alot of people burn nike's today im sad im wearing addidas :-(
Chevy has a deal with Colin Kaepernick too....patiently waiting on the truck burning videos guys....
You see people are only burning those trash Nikes you buy at Walmart Those needed to be burned anyway.
Strongly Agree. Those that stand up like these gents inspire strong opinions. Strong opinions inspire conversation. Lets hope those conversations inspire much-needed societal change.
I guess you could participate in the but if you dont, Ninja Cop shirts go really well with these shoes
what happened?

Yall really get on my nerves with this shit.

I can't wait 2c the swoosh on a pair of police R pigs socks. That bothered me more than anything he did or said. I'm no legal eagle, I bet he wins his lawsuit. Ironically he'd profit more off kneeling & sacrifice nothing while never playing another down in the NFL.
Yall fucking dummies really burning yall shoes


Don't spread the poison. gets advertisement by people wearing their stuff.
Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Like democracy.

How again is it fault that Colin Kaepernick knelt for the anthem?


I saw that coming - (eye roll) Not burning my Nike sneakers / clothing. But maybe I can try to unload these ass ugly YZY sneakers again. I got these as a gift a few yrs ago,I look like a idiot in them and they have been in my closet for 3 yrs now.
anyone who doesnt want their Nike stock please send it to me, Ill hold it for them.
Anyone else skeptic of Nike partnering with Kaepernick? Or should I see re-partnering... They have had a partnership since 2011. But as Kaepernick was receiving interest from other co. Nike decides to jump on things.
Maybe...maybe not.
Them - we are going to AdidasAdidas -
$nke stock down 3% already. Most transparent BS marketing gimmick of all time. Short
If Kaepernick really wanted help the oppressed he would from the democrats and vote republican. .

Disappointing decision
So are you saying is NOT advocacy journalism? Really? More stupid than I thought.
Colin Kaepernick (a benched, multi-millionaire athlete being paid millions by ) has a warped idea of what it means to 'sacrifice everything'. It is true, though, he sacrificed truth for a lie by promoting propaganda.

Dear Nike: You might want to evaluate your current blunder. This is what results from boneheaded moves.
If you feel like taking part in , by all means do so... but before you burn or throw away perfectly good shoes and clothes, why not consider donating them to a local Boys and Girls Club or even your local school district?! Every little bit helps!
1!
I hope the is real so I can get these with ease
A little advice for the folks
Anyone boycotting and throwing away your Air Max's can you boycott them my way?
IMMA KEEP BUYING ALL THE G FAZOS NIGGA FUCK A

PRO TIP: Take OFF your shoes before burning them. Stupidity is considered a "pre-existing" condition, so it's no longer covered under the ACA.
I Didn't know all i simply had to do was kneel when the National Anthem is playing while everybody is standing, for to notice me...what a way to keep society civil.

My favorite things about the so far...1.) It's backfired into a great marketing campaign for Nike while calling more attention to Kaepernick's fight.2.) Idiots burning Nikes and saying "Chucks are better." (Converse has been a subsidiary of Nike since 2003.)
How executives looking at people participating in this with items they spent money on.

I got love for !!
This is so funny who cares about this guy Kapernick. Don't destroy the things you worked for to buy. Destroy his false narrative. If he really cared he would be in the inner city's of Chicago trying to fix the killings going on there.
So far today, stock is down 2.45%. They prioritized radical left politics over their employees and shareholders.

Nike shares hit as Kaepernick ad spurs boycott
Its fine if you want to boycott Nike, go for it. But destroying stuff you already bought and own doesnt do anything to hurt them, all that does is hurt you. A boycott is to prevent them getting your money, not to burn what they already have your money for.

Now, is a good time to buy Nike stocks.

Now if only we could figure out a way to get them to boycott oxygen....Oo! I know! We could tell them Hillary is pro-breathing!

Colin Kapernick has been under contract with Nike since 2011. If you are joining the today, you really should do better research and not wait for Fox News to tell you what to be angry about.
Wait until the people boycotting Nike hear that Rose Tico from Star Wars is the next spokesperson.
CC: the whole
This is one of 3 pairs of Nike shoes I own. They are comfortable & have held up well. Please tell me why it's going to hurt Nike to destroy a something with their logo when you paid for it? If you don't want them maybe you should give them to someone who needs them
I guess now when we see somebody wearing Nike, theyre probly OK
Amen to this.


TIMEOUT NIKE is the primary sponoser of the NFL so every team wears Nike ... Colin Kaepernick is the new face of the Nikes Campaign. Lol so now y'all legit can't get rid of him Nike legit the biggest troll
Screw you Nike! You can have these damn sneakers back!!!!
Breaking news...Nike already has your money. They are now loaning out their own lighters.
This story says it all . John Brennan is now on your side!
never again will I buy anything nike
The stuff these idiots are burning are the discontinued discount stuff you get at bargain stores.
Are we sparking the flames of change ....or fanning the flames of old ways
Burn your shit if you want to. You already bought it.
ENOUGH is ENOUGH
Nike stock down, keep tweeting folks show them what MAGA means!
I think we should take the a step further & boycott our governments so long as they continue to destroy our nations by pursuing open-borders globalization.

And this
They finally got trending, 18hrs after they got triggered. Well done, bye bye

What you mean? No "Roll Tide"?
Now Im going to look even better in Nike Merchandise
To all the standing with Nike Here's one from for you!

Hope people don't boycott twinkies. I got a .01 percent stake.
this cannot be real

Congrats to !

Colon ought to be a spokesperson for rhinoplasty.

I can picture Steve Bannon now wearing 4 shirts and a pair of Ivanka Trump high heels boycotting Nike

Why would you burn your gear if you already spent A LOT of cash on it?! Give it away instead of burning up your money
lol.
For those people who actually wish to participate in the urge you to please consider donating your items instead of burning them for a few minutes of internet fame.Some great orgs are as always your local shelter.
Why does it have to be "instead"? Why not "both"?

The is as bullshit as the who started it.
..countries that produce the most Nike merchandise pay some of the lowest wages. Vietnam has the most Nike contract factory workers. Those workers in 2001 earned the equivalent of¬†$73.94¬†per month in 2014 U.S. dollars.May 20, 2014
Wow!!!! hitting hard. Net loss at the moment sits at $4.2 billion, with a "B".Down a whopping 3.2%. Early prediction that things will get worse over the next month or so, as people consuming their products take a hard pass on Nike when purchasing at retailers.


If you actually have a real emotional response about the , you might consider taking a step back and assessing your current place in life.
If you're really that wound up about this (you shouldn't be) that you are going to toss/burn your gear, consider donating it instead. Homeless/needy folks are less discerning when it comes to media campaigns.
Lol. Believe in being a loser, then go with Nike.

People you cannot burn everything. Last year was tiki torches. This year Nikes.
If you can, instead of buying shoes, buy stock!!! Get that portfolio diversified. Lol.
Guess whos going on a Nike shopping spree
you think the Tillman Family sacrificed? Where is that ad?
Whats happening
this is everything...
Totally am buying stock in Nike very soon
Send me your unwanted Nike shoes (I will pay for shipping), don't want you wasting them .


Feb. 2018, in my town, 2 cops were murdered responding to a domestic violence call. THEY sacrificed everything keeping my town safe. Kaepernick wore "cops as pigs" socks. A multi-millionaire who plays a game for a job talking about "sacrifice". Fuck you Nike.
What has Colin Kaepernick done since leaving the NFL to help with his issue? Besides complaining how he hasn't been signed by anybody, and suing the NFL?
Anyone participating in the can glady donate your gear to me sis is broke Ill gladly take them
Niggas really out here burning Nikes and taking this to heart... Damn, Alexa play Nikes by Frank Ocean

Lol Goodwill and Platos Closet is about to have all of the Nike gear.
The entire is based on h8.


Since only cares about money lets help them go bankrupt. Im not buying their products anymore. The things I have with their name or logo on it will never see the light of day again. Take that!
Welcome to my Ted Talk.
Way to grow your stocks for your investors. However thought this was a good idea should be fired.
SACRIFICE? What do YOU know about sacrifice?! What about our ? REAL MEN sacrificing themselves to protect others! I'm sure those who don't come home would love to have one more day on soil. If they did, one shoe they would not be wearing is .
I am out in the neighbourhood if I see anyone wearing Nikes Im going to hit them with my shovel.
Ooohhh the accuracy.....
I would like someone to explain to me what exactly Kaepernicks movement is supposed to be about. Other than he needed to find something to stay relevant
I like to have enough information before posting. Now that I do, my official statement is:

did nothing but get on his knees. Should we put prostitution up on ads too??
I bet Nike feels like NWA felt when people bought their CDs and destroyed them as they do about people burning their own paid for merchandise ... They bought them motherfuckers

TEAM LONSDALE INIT MAAATE
Facts I got a whole fit on fuck
People out here cutting holes in their clothes looking like... lol

<<since 2000 lmao. Pos shoe
My question about the is when are all 50 states going to REQUIRE for the upcoming 2018 elections?
From this point its . s was never about brands or anthems though!!!! Smh.
Couldnt Nike come up with a more deserving person instead of a controversial one. We are advertising for them by talking about it..
all their apparel should be on the ground where it belongs.
These comments in the whew Chile
is the thing trending on my Twitter feed. Are you boycotting Nike?


Checking Twitter in the morning is a good way to find what you're supposed to be outraged about.
So wearing a pair of Nikes is a political statement now? Trumpanzies are crazy af.
Idk why people are burning their Nike merch like Nike is gonna care. Lmaooo you already bought it dummies

I have no need for a . I haven't bought their crap since I was in high school in the 80's.
If you hate Nike and wear a size 11.5-12 DM me lol
Most of you that wanna switch up on Nike dont buy the good ones anyway...
Also, this man sacrificed everything. The only thing Kap sacrificed was a spot on the bench.
I miss the days when buying shoes was an apolitical exercise.They fit - check!They're comfortable - check!They look good - check!They're on sale - check!They align with my political views - ... ah crap.
Not Buying Nike Brands... stand with John Rich!
...It's still funny. (shouldn't it be ?)
And Ill never buy anything again
I think Nike will regret making this decision.
case 2 b made to reelect Dem Senators who vote to confirm
Oops.
Kaepernick promised NFL teams he would stand for the anthem during his last noodle armed tour of failure around the league. Really taking a stand there, Kaep.

Weird how is all of a sudden on my mind...
Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. If y'all really want to show how pissed y'all are, go buy all the Nike attire and footwear you can afford. Than destroy them and post it on twitter. That'll teach Nike to side with "Niggers"
Waiting to see a Nike Burnerdestroy a pair of Jordans.Got my popcorn.

Yep, Ice Cube went broke when they burned NWA records.
This whole is stupid.
I will never buy anything again with the logo or affiliation on it.
Everyone knows these people are wearing sketchers and new balances anyway

Dont burn your shoes people. Give them to goodwill.

Yo I need ya to bring Nike stock down to like $10, so I can stock up

Wtf Nike do to these people for them to be burning shit they already bought...lmfao


Looking at the tweets, some people are beyond saving. Not worth trying to reason with them. =/
This drop is only the beginning ...elephants NEVER forget!
you're a fucking garbage can.
doing this.Kids in sweatshops for hard labor on a shitty, overpriced product.But, now that some guy you don't like signs a deal with them, NOW you boycott?

Im gonna boycott by buying all Nike everything for the next 4 months. Do they do make-up and TP?
Should have done years ago for over pricing Jordans
Without taking a stance on the , I predict this will be the largest single sales day in their company history due to the alone.
Dealing with these ignorant dummies is like dealing with a bunch of toddlers: dont get their way, throw a tantrum & make a scene (burning $200 sneakers), tire themselves out, go down for a nap so the adults can get on with the rest of the day
so now we're going to boycott Sean Hannity's wardrobe
Let me know if yall really boycotting so I can get my grape 5s when they re-release
He sacrificed everything? What about Pat Tillman. Bye Nike!

Blaine Gabbert beat him out. Hes not one of the best. He cant cut it.

At least we destroy our on property not like you who destroys others peoples property when you have a issue.

Triggered conservatives are the biggest snow flakes!!
As for me, the earliest I can get to the store for my own Nikes would be Wednesday, possibly Thursday. Id rather buy my own than beg a magat for theirs.
yall really burning and destroying items that yall already PAID for.... LMAO boo boo the fucking fool
Will be wearing my proudly!
Nike Shares Dip as Kaepernick Ad Spurs Boycott :
Where is Nike made?Most of the factories are located in Asia, including Indonesia, China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, Philippines, and Malaysia. Nike is hesitant to disclose information about the contract companies it works with.
Nike is finished gambled on the wrong person
Morality unfortunately fights one in a million.
where you going to do Newt Gingrich don't make no shoes

I stopped buying Nike years ago, when they started marketing their overpriced shoes to people that couldn't afford food, much less tennis shoes.
To all those burning , I happen to take size 11 and would love, I mean loathe to own a pair of Air Jordans. DM for shipping information.
This is incredibly ignorant. Also not true. But ignorant nonetheless.
Im going to buy so many Nike things today at Dicks!
I never saw an urban child die over a pair of Reeboks

Vayan y quemen estos tmb
I bought my 1st pair of Nikes in years a few years ago-neon pink! Loved them! Sad to say I will be donating them now, but I can't keep them knowing Nike has no ethics or morals!

Might be time to buy that Nike stock once it plummets to the bottom.

Nike stock $NKE is down $3.10 (3.77%) this morning. Thats actually $5 BILLION down the drain! Still dont think is losing any money?


Shoe size-7.5, shorts-L, shirt-M; please send me all your Nike clothes instead of burning it. Thanks -Poor College Student :)
I love the comments on all of the shit.
need ?         ™Ÿä_ÿ™ÿ™ÿÆÿ±ÿ¨

I mean, we have to hand it to NIKE, they have now convinced all the woke leftist to buy their capitalistic apparel made in child sweat shops that line the pockets of Nike execs with loads of cash.
Here is my thought on


Ive got a lot of wrestling shoes to burn!
Went shopping this weekend. There was a huge line outside of the store, but not the store.
If this dumb ass results in it being easier for me to score limited edition kicks, I am going to be stoked.


Nike stock down almost $3,000,000,000 (2.01%) in market capitalization at the open today. Somebody in the marketing department should be looking for a new job.
Yall acting like 6 year olds who didnt get what they wanted on Christmas. Shows how much hate is in this world..
Ill take yalls mens 11.5 shoes HMU
put out a safety warning "Do Not Light Your Nike Apperal on Fire While You're Still Wearing it"
Would somebody please post exactly where these sneakers are made. That alone is worth a
Not only that, but you're burning products that you ALREADY PAID FOR. has your coins already! You aren't hurting them. Now you don't have any shoes to workout in. You're hurting yourself.

If anyone wears a 10.5 and is going to , can I get your shoes since you wont be wearing them?

Yall know they already have your money from the stuff youre now burning and wasting...go off though
People doing the are so cringe haha.
this is absurd. If anyone participating in this actually thinks their withdrawal from Nike sales is remotely relevant, then let them rage in ignorance.
fu.? K Nike
Burning clothes doesn't work. Not buying products and SELLING MUTUAL FUNDS THAT OWN NIKE REALLY WORKS!! SELL, SELL
Nike is a billion dollar company. I don't think a few Trumpies burning their shoes is going to hurt their profit margins.
™Ÿä_ÿ™ÿ™ÿÆÿ±ÿ¨ >>Cree en algo, aunque eso signifique sacrificarlo todo, Nike escoge a Colin Kaepernick, jugador de la NFL como rostro de su √∫ltima campa√±a.

Clearly, we no longer possess the capacity for reasoned debate and principled values. All political and social "values" have been reduced to spectacle and social media stunts.

Everybody boycotting Nike wears New Balance anyway.
watching people burn their shoes after they already paid for them.
Id like to thank for waking up the Red Wave. Lets ride this all the way to the midterm elections in November!

Pre-market, Nike stock was down -2.84.In the first five minutes of trading, it bounced back to -1.48. It wiped a pre-market loss in half in 5 minutes. Have a nice .

Ooh dearie me! Have you ?

Way to miss the point! Democrats are always missing the point. You have to explain everything to them. The Democratic Party is a self-selecting subset of people who miss the point.

Nike is a billion dollar company who can give 0 fucks what ppl think is trash and a waste of time people buy Nikes everyday so foh


This is so stupid. Not only does these people looks foolish destroying their property, and probably sitting somewhere getting a laugh of how these idiots are wasting their life destroying their Nike apparel. This solves nothing!
IRAN and N.F.L. cut a deal for Football team...if Nikes Nike will allow Colin Kaepernick to play.
where was this energy for child labor sad y'all more concerned about an anthem then actual human beings
This is truly a level of stupid I cant believe Im actually witnessing. Whats next? If Dove care for Men sponsors Kaepernich, are these people going to walk around punching themselves in the face?

Agree!! We r disappointed in Nike.
So signs to a deal and all these conservatives are calling for a boycott? I thought boycotting was what Liberals do not real conservatives? Then conservatives cant complain when Liberals want to boycott a burger joint.

So many tears folks might drown in them this week.

New podcast up now The face of Nike
1. To those of you burning shoes and cutting good condition articles of clothing with scissors... 2. Please do two things.3. Give these items to the homeless or organization accepting donations. 4. Have your head examined by doctor if you chose option 1.
Its so funny how all these people who refer to the left as elite are able to burn hundreds upon hundreds of dollars of merchandise without giving it a second thought. Makes you wonder who the true elites are.

These are available on Amazon - buy one to counter the buy one to burn if that's your thrill.

I will take any & all apparel and shoes yall are getting rid of. Size 13 shoe... Hit me up. Also, look hard enough into Adidas, UA, Reebok, Puma, etc and I'm sure you'd find things/decisions you disagree with, but you won't boycott them. This is personal.
I still havent seen anyone burn a Jordan! Im patient, Ill wait!
Yes, is trending, but can we take a knee to ask that you spot the error here!

Hey! Everyone participating in the . How are the boycotts for Walmart and Starbucks going for ya?
If you're destroying your own clothes, you're a fucking idiot.
If everyone will post a pic of their new shoes today, this would be a real success!There are so many errors in our thinking...if wed only think before we think, maybe wed have a better quality thought
This is full of fuckin snowflakes man like get a fucking job or sumn lol

Questa storia del sta letteralmente sfuggendo di mano
burning your old ratty sneakers isn't brave. Go buy a brand new pair of NIKE. That will show them jerks how much you care!
This idiot wound up in the hospital lolol
Did you know that Nike also owns all of the shops that produce automatic weapons? And confederate flags and monuments? And Breitbart and InfoWars?
Nike hates the police...
Alas, I was a Nike fan for years but all things eventually come to an end.
Who do you think would make a better face for ?
The Confederate flag is a symbol of hate and treason. It should be burned. Not Nike.

Everyone participating in , what are you possibly going to wear to college football games this year? The Jordan brand is Nike too




This boycott is against Trump

So, youd rather them put a murderer on the cover?

Of well, guess lll Currently be looking for a new brand of kicks Will still try and watch some football if I have time to find a game without anyone kneeing in it

Kaepernick took a class on self promotion from Omarosa. Hes a pawn. Nike is the company that wants to be the face of kneeling. I hope it hurts their bottom line. Its the only thing that is more important than their politics.

Lmaaaao yesss destroy your Nikes, ya dummies.

burning nike shoes and gear won't get your money back. that ship has sailed and all you'll get is a video telling everyone you destroyed a $100+ pair of shoes. maybe put politics aside for a minute and donate the stuff to a local shelter. those people need it.

Everbody involved in the probably wear crocs, sandals and skechers anyway

MT via:
Hey all you libtards living in your parent's basement celebrating what Nike did, after today Mom and Dad are going to have less money to buy you Nike shit.
Are you still wearing Nike, a lot of people want to know?
Couldn't be more EXPECTED coming from John Brennan--the only CIA director to ever vote for a communist presidential candidate or to ever hack into the Senate Intelligence Committee computers.

If you had any question about who is going to win the midterms in November, the number one trend on Twitter this morning is !

All these bitches burnin nikeeeees
The tweeters: 10% Actually boycotting90% Name calling This goes for both sides
easiest boycott yet!!!
Kaepernick's kneeling is not genuine. Started it to get attention when he sucked at football. NO corporation should ever take a political stance. Commerce is commerce. R.I.P.
Anybody burning a size 12 in Huaraches?



There, its fixed.
Y'all MAGA DICKHEADS burning Nike gear y'all already bought as if Nike hasn't already profited off y'all already...
I wish execs would be petty and post a video of them sitting in their conference room counting their money, smoking a cigar and laughing their asses off at videos of people burning Nike products they paid for.
burning nike stuff is like being at work and not standing for the anthem. both actions really do have better options!!!!!!

Added another name to boycott pro football.
So Nikes gonna sign someone who didnt stand for the anthem!!!!!Here's what I think about that!!!

The Inspiration Behind Sounds from the Other Side EP ‚Äì Wizkid - Miracle

I'm pretty sure those that are boycotting Nike never bought Nike in the first place.
Colin Kaepernick explains why he won't stand during National Anthem a lot of people really need to see this or see this again.
Kaepernick was a backup QB BEFORE the he started kneeling. Anyone calling him "one of the best quarterbacks" is embarrassing themselves.
Believe in something.Even if it means sacrificing everything.
People at work already talking about they're never buying any Nike again.

Starter Pack
Amazing how is trending this morning. Timing is everything, Nike. Shouldve waited until after Jack meets Congress. Lmao! Twitter may actually be working properly for the brief moment.
I unintentionally have on flyknits and a Nike dri-fit as I tweet. Lol
Dude, I really can't fuck with Twitter. People are fucking stupid and it stresses me tf out. All these dumb ass, wannabe internet evangelists and the like going on with their and shitting on a man who's trying to see change in the place and people he loves.
Big & Rich singer urges over Colin Kaepernick ad: "Reebok, here we come."
Where's a good place to buy Nike products so I can participate in the ?
I see what you did there, .

Imagine feeling so strongly about something that you're willing to make your feelings known by burning expensive gear you've bought from a brand that is now represented by a guy who feels so strongly about something that he was willing to risk everything for it!
i wear converse, not bc of the bc thats fucking stupid, but bc they are cool
Swoosh...... Nike is NO MORE!




+ keep OH forgot too
enough said.


Niggas out here destroying Nike Product , but forgot they could donate Idiots
Oh don't neglect the be sure you burn their jerseys as well.
If You Are Boycotting You Are Apart Of The Problem .
Burning goods you have already bought isnt a economic boycott. It's wasteful. Why not donate to charities.
Buh bye

is total
Will you buy Nike still?
Y'all doing this, but sure, the left are the ones triggered smh
I will provide you the targeted lead generation as per your needs.
How much attention were you paying to Nike prior to this week?Exactly.
The is some silly shit. Kap STILL getting those Nike checks
am not into boycotting, but how could they make a "bone headed" decision by hiring Kaepernick? Stock down 3%.
. Some people will always try to make the issue something other than the uncomfortable one they are actively avoiding.
Why are people boycotting Nike or worried about cap when half the world can't afford Nike or doesn't have a electricity to watch cap
This is what it means to sacrifice everything.
2% down on early trading. How low will it go?
Was about to tweet how the only thing keeping is trending is people saying it shouldn't be trending. Then I saw some dickhead burning his shoes ffs

CHECKS OVER STRIPES
Colton this gig.....
Even my eyeballs be too lazy to roll at such stupidity
I'm sure the will have zero impact on those fine folks but instead of cutting up or burning your gear, consider boxing/bagging it up and donating it to a Goodwill or shelter, it slightly lessens the stupidity of destroying your own property! Thx!
So true.
Really a ....stupid voice

It really pisses me off that so many go without and theses assholes are burning shoes so desperately needed.
Big & Rich singer urges over Colin Kaepernick ad: "Reebok, here we come."
Hey conservatives: you can *totally* own the libs if you hurl your shoes out the window. Works best if you keep them on, though, believe me!
If you like Nike. Keep buying Nike. Their products are still top quality. Even if they need a new marketing and brand manager.
Anybody else waiting for to jump on the hashtag and say something stupid???
when is the apparel being sold I need some new gear!


I don't even like sports (cool if you do) but all this and stuff has hit me square in the feels. ? Nah.
Nike advertising agents now: " I KNEW we should have chosen Harvey Weinstein as our representative."

Do people not realize with the you already bought the product that you are destroying. You gave the company your money already....
So now that is the face of yall are destroying merch you already paid for? Grow up.

Funny a lot of those people bought Nike shoes and products, Nike already has your money, burning and destroy your products doesnt do a thing
This dont make any sense for those who already purchased merchandise. You are basically wasting everyones time cutting off an emblem on a pair of shorts/socks you are still going to wear and leave the inside tag on.


Agree forever
Wait are people all joining now?

Most Trumpbot Maga-sheep who want to "boycott" Nike don't even wear and never would wear Nike. GTFO with you and your Faded Glory shoes you bought at Wal*Mart.
I absolutely love all of these boycotts. I get to watch the most unintelligent fucks in the universe threaten to take down major corporations and all they end up doing is literally setting themselves on fire.
Cracka ass Cracka shit in full effect this morning

I bought this stylin set of Reebok at the Northshore Mall out in Boston 8 or 9 years ago & are still practicly brand new C6
Owning the libs is for sure fun in the moment, but then you have no socks to wear for the first day of the semester.
Soooo.... who going to burn they Jordans?

kneeled for God and did not want to play another possession. He also sacrificed everything and lost his Football career. The sports world did not back his kneeling for God and you back up Kaepernick SMH
Pretty sure would care about Pat Tillman's death too seeing how the government tried to cover up his friendly fire death.

Keeping it simple FUCK NIKE
I don't own any shoes (I do have some socks), but hey, is owned by Nike, and I love my Chucks.
- hey keep your politics out of your shoes. Good PR stunt although will cost you dearly in the long run. Christmas shopping begins in 60 days. Sales tank is my prediction as blames it on everything and everyone besides themselves.

A washed up football player trying to avoid his own crappy legacy, yeah
Im reppin Nike
So for everyone on this could you please donate your items to charity or heck DM me, I have a co-workers' family lose a lot due to a fire. So yeah if you're gonna boycott do some good with it since you "believe" so much.
Nike sales are only going to go up.
Not going to lie, Nike hasnt had good shoes or clothes in a long time so technically I already boycotted them a long time ago
The ask Starbucks how THAT boycott worked out.
Last thought. Since y'all are boycotting , please be sure to let me know if you have some hot pink chucks, size 8. I'm assuming you're including (owned by Nike) in this insanity. Thanks.
PLEASE if the trumpies on our football thing say ONE thing about this im gonna tell them their football gear is from nike

we should have been boycotting Nike for decades once we found out their sweatshop conditions for foreign workers... but no its "da foozball man who dont wanna stand up" that makes you mad. Have fun with the toxic smoke shoe burners haha

They are still really mad.
So people boycotting Nike cuz of Colin kapernick

Great line in the new add. The accompanying pic, however, should be a flag draped coffin.
Not one pair of Nikes that have been burnt looks even remotely decent.When people start burning Js, then Ill believe this nonsense.
Watching videos of people cutting up their Nike sportswear.........human society is doomed.
Judiciary Committee Team of Nine
And that one guy who nuked his shoes with a drone strike. History will remember him.

Oh the irony. The ppl who are mad at Nike are the children of the people who hated Ali during his time. Lol. You aren't fooling anyone.

Home girl said They dont sell Nike at Walmart. Yall good!Lord I am H O L L E R I N G
I was thinking about buying a new pair of shoes and guess what? Now is the perfect time to do so..
How does burning your sneakers and cutting up socks hurt ? Pretty sure you guys didnt think that one through.

you could also have a clearance section that provides cheap shoes for burning and destroying. Money flowing in everywhere. Get ‚Äòem while their hot!
Donating junk does nobody any favors
For those burning your Nikes, enjoy your New Balances lol

How ya gone bpycott Nike but ya kids love the culture?
I have to get me some Nike stuff now. So fun to own the Twumps.

Stand for something. Or Fall for anything.

Shame on you Nike love ur shoes, not anymore.

Never bought anything...
Will you still buy Nike apparel or are you boycotting it?

How about instead of destroying your Nike products to ; you donate that to the less fortunate, homeless, or those in other countries.

Watching people burn or destroy Nike products they have already paid for is kind of funny. Although, they could donate the stuff and do more good instead of doing some macho posturing

People like you didn't think a boycott could hurt the NFL brand but it did. The revenue earned was in 2017 prior to the new face of Nike. will bring down their stock prices Oh wait that already has happened since there announcement.
Going to buy me some today. Anti .
I sure hope all the boycotters with their shoes on fire, boycott the upcoming midterm elections too
And how long it takes them to decide that...
I dont think I understand. You should buy at least 3 more pair and burn those, too. I may get it then. Receipt pics or it didnt happen!

for a man who can't find a job in the NFL.. And the boycott is for why? I'm waiting
Nike's stockholders may not be so happy when they see the next quarterly earnings...
In my mind, the people burning their Nikes, shoes look like this! Shouldve been burned them joints!!!!
People wanna boycott Nike but not the neo-nazis and KKK members that was strolling through Washington and Charlottesville!!
I'm forever with the swoosh
I need some new golf shoes .. guess where the money is not going..

Heres an idea for all you stupid to . Lol
I have to laugh at people calling for a . Read the ad copy. This is exactly what you did. You believed in 45, and now you're sacrificing everything.

this is a real thing ?! Yall wanna be oppressed so damn bad
I like cake
Republicans: Im all in for the Im never buying a product from them again.Nike and 99% of the world:
I doubt it will. It looks like they based this decision on twitter "engagement" (likes/retweets). Not a smart move when you realize how many adversarial countries & billionaire oligarchs are running CIA style psyop botnets.
Nike gon start making more bank now cuz of yall stupid asses
This is comedy.. to see folks boycott something they never really purchased in the first place... Oh & your fav NFL team is wearing Nike
My thoughts on the : I've been doing that since the whole sweatshop thing became public. I only wear Reebok or Adidas.

100%
Lots of advertising for Nike today without them even having to pay for it.
So i guess Im actually going to be buying more Nikes now. Trumpers are so stupid. And poor and generally unfit. Not the Nike demographic.
There Nike we fixed it for you.
Nike apparently doesn't know what Sacrifice is.

2 of the shortest punt returns in college football history in 3 days and one of them belongs to Eric Kumah
Well is already trending i love it I knew this was coming
I don't buy Nike stuff due do the fact that in the 90's, they paid MJ more than the entirety of their production workforce.
To those destroying their tennis shoes. You do know they've already gotten your money. What you're doing does not affect their bottom line. However, If you don't want yours, I wear a size 9 in ladies.
The left: you buy in to the beliefs of the entire tribe or youre out.
Its a shame wasnt able to find the number for a suicide hotline in time.

This boycott is one of the dumbest non making sense moment I have ever seen
I see the are out here fake boycotting Nike.

I wonder whats going to happen to all these teams (i.e. college teams) that promote Nike products
Ah... the . Gotta look out for some running shoes at a red state garage sale to go with my year-old Keurig machine.
So was a player until he decided to take a knee. Now he is a shoe salesman.

To all you dumb motherfuckers who are doing the this is for you
I guarantee you 90% of people participating in the have never bought a Nike product in their lives, or only bought very casually.
Pigs in a blanket, fry 'm like bacon.
its only one ethnic group I see saying boycott Nike but to the people who Colin Kaepernick is doing this for we salute and
Most of the people that are mad at for signing Colin Kaepernick probably can't afford them anyway. (If you are mad at a guy for wanting his people to be treated fairly.....congrats on being the problem!)
These junts hArd As hell RT : All you assholes burning Nike shit should be wearing these anyway. Good for Nike.

This is the first time I've ever not felt like a total pile of shit for owning 40+ pairs of nikes. Thanks !
Adidas

Maybe the will finally get chads to stop wearing high nike socks with literally anything
What makes MAGA idiots even more idiotic destroying Nike merchandise is that most of their sneakers retail for $70 to $200.

I bought these not too long ago without an ounce of shame! The truth is so loud that you cant ignore it.
its actually funny how bad conservatives are at boycotting products
Its beyond me that people still dont understand the reason Kaepernick took a knee. People like political propaganda rather than researching. You guys like to ride someone elses wave. Well I and I got time today
from should be watched very carefully by and to make sure isn't deliberately tanking their own stock for a massive buyback. ?
All we need now is universal health care and then we can get the trump people to start boycotting healthcare.

May he rest in pieces
its called marketing, people! Nike will make billions off of both sides from sweat shop labor.

These political Boycotts are getting stupid. Companies & organizations making every single thing political are stupid. Political triggerism daily is becoming an illness.
This proves how people can be really dumb.

Sacrifice? This is what sacrifice looks like...
That's it! I'm putting all my stuff in a pile.....so I can find an outfit to wear today entirely made of nike
Tillman wore Nike before U.S. corporations thought it made sense to politicize their products and lose half their buying audience in the process. This is purely a PR stunt for Nike, one that might generate short-term gains but long-term pain.
First world problems
Remember when conservatives boycotted Star Wars and then it only made one Billion dollars?

Trumpsters/ Conservatives in the : I hate to break this to u, but when Nike decided to green-light this campaign, they had already done the math. They expected losers like u to boycott but knew that there'll be plenty of other ppl to replace u in their clientele.

I'll be wearing my Nike kicks. I Nike

Somehow, I think Nike will survive the as will its subsidiaries: Converse, Hurley International, Cole Haan, Umbro Ltd...the list goes on. Stupid MAGA fuckers.


Fools on morons of the decade

I'm going to buy my a pair of Nike's today ! Thank you Nike for all you do .
Maybe they should get Nike tattoos on their biceps and cut off their arms to own the libtards!!!
To everyione burning shoes: There's no point in burning shoes that you already bought. You aren't telling them anything other than that you will literally burn your own money.

Nike stock $NKE is down $1.84 (2.24%) in pre-market trading this morning. Thats actually $3 BILLION down the drain. Even to a company worth billions, $3 billion is a lot!

So that's the real reason they are cutting out the logo! to be able to see through their Nike clothes

Instead of burning your Nikes, why not donate them? Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing your shoes.

Good luck making shoes for clowns Athletes wont be wearing them.

I will no longer be purchasing these products as long as they carry that Kaepernick campaign!
Nike knows who their cutomers are and it ain't you MAGA dumbasses. Your shoes are at the Family Dollar. Your boycott will hurt Nike about as much as you hurt Nordstoms.
Alo ajd dajte najk stvari ako vam ne trebaju
When the Leader of Iran agreed with the decision you made, Nike you really stepped in it.

Nope... Burn'em!
Nike knows who their cutomers are and it ain't you MAGA dumbasses. Your shoes are at the Family Dollar. Your boycott will hurt Nike about as much as you hurt Nordstoms.
Mark this day, conservatives are more angry at their shoes than they are at trans people.
Interesting how the bots are getting testy with their responses. As if they know theyre on the wrong side of history.

Angry boycotters: "I'm destroying my Nike products!"Nike: "The products you already bought?"Angry Boycotters: "Yes"Nike: ""
I have gone old school and wear Reeboks. Today gonna wall into a store and buy me some Nikes.
The silver lining: your KKK robe doesnt have a swoosh so you wont need to burn anything.

Conservative boycotts are pathetic.

Ahhh...thank you all for ripping off your items of clothing. We can finally see what you have been hiding underneath those snazzy garments- YOUR KKK hoods and robes!

Looking for a pair of Jordan XIs. Lets talk before you decide to destroy.
Man I hope these people participating in the have money. That stuff is too expensive to be ripping up and burning!

This is the real definition of sacrificing everything
Are you with or are you against Nike?

Stupid, stupid, stupid...the SJW corporate execs continue to think their actions have no consequences.
Good job Nike. I havent seen stupidity like this since target played with their bathrooms.
Twitter hides comments posting this image.
Kaepernick wears socks depicting police as pigs. EMAIL YOUR INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND DEMAND THAT ALL YOUR NIKE STOCK BE SOLD. Ask for mutual funds that do not hold Nike Stock.
Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything
Mood. I'd rather stand for something instead of
Don't do It.
No more Nike for me.
Yall so stupid!!!However its an excellent way to block you dummiesCarry on

Ya Some Ignorant FUCKS!
the thing that's tiresome with nike is that they only chose kapernick for the publicity they probably all vote trump anyway.
Instead of burning your shoes, how about DONATING THEM!? Or is that idea too radical for your small minds?
I wish people cared more about (fill in the blank) more than what an athlete wears.
Oh this is what yall want.
Most Trumpbot Maga-sheep who want to "boycott" Nike don't even wear and never would wear Nike. GTFO with you and your Faded Glory shoes you bought at Wal*Mart.
I've got 2 old Nike t-shirts, more than 10 years old - there's never been a better time to throw them out. I've never owned any other Nike products, and from now on I never will. There's a reason Michael Jordan NEVER mentioned politics - Nike somehow forgot why
this will be a boycott of epic proportions....and guess what? CK still won't be playing in the NFL, well done.

The logic behind :"We're not burning the Nikes, we're 'lighting' them"

wont work.
People burning their Nikes...LOL like yall doing something to them... They already have ya money baby
Ive aleays prefered over
Destroying your sneakers YOU PAID for with YOUR MONEY? People are so dumb!
So yall big mad, huh? Damn. To bad their to well established top give a fuck. If they weren't they wouldn't have did the commercial...

Its a good job Nike dont make KKK hoods, otherwise there wouldve been a logistical nightmare on the horizon
Yes, destroy clothes instead of donating them to those in need. Brilliant solution
ALL THESE PEOPLE ON THIS HASHTAG KNOW DAMN WELL THEY STILL GONNA WEAR NIKE
Nike should realize that while younger people wear their shoes its most likely the parents that buy them for their kids. Parents can say NO to Nike and suggest a different brand.
The people (?) doing the screams that left-leaning people are snowflakes. And they're not that smart if they already bought the product and are destroying it. The company already has their money!
What they gonna do? Rip those $150 back to school shoes off their kids?
You mean a bunch of fools cutting up socks that theyve ALREADY paid for? Your money that Nike ALREADY has? Yeah...you really showed them.

Maybe they can slash prices at Nike like they did with H&M
not necessary when the company sucked anyway already!Last cool shoe was Jordans!
Glad to know where some peoples priorities lie
PLEASE stop burning clothes and shoes and socks!! Do you know how many barefoot people i see on a daily basis?! People who count on plastic bags as shirts?! Please donate if you dont want them anymore! This is obscene!
Nike will have plenty of outdated shoes in their inventory to make donations for the holidays.
Thank you Nike and Colin Kaepernick....signed GOP midterm election committee!
With those jeans...I agree.
... yall burning the weakest pairs of shoes for attention. Yikes.


If you want to boycott Nike go ahead!But donate your Nike products pleaseBeing a good person comes first!
The majority of policemen are good honest people, not pigs, as mr K depicts them! How about that Nike?
I will burn my 10 Pairs of shoes and then I will go and buy 10 new pairs of shoesI hope that will teach them a lesson!!
Boycott Nike all you want. All you're doing is encouraging people like me to invest in new kicks. (Spoiler alert: They're Nikes.)
Goodbye Nike. My ancestors were serfs. Work to make things better with constructive positive actions. Actions always speak louder than words.
I bought some 's last night! and I will walk proudly in them! .

Nike sure as hell will be getting my coin. All the butthurt dummies cutting up old ass socks that they already purchased......ya big mad huh?
Man these anti-libtard types are really pissed off on Twitter. Can't believe Lewis CK got a shoe deal with Nike tho. /s
Im a size 8 for anyone who wants to send their stuff my way. .
My niece wanted a pair of Adidas for her birthday... Ive always bought Glad I bought the Adidas!
who the fuck come out with this shit
Let's be honest. Those who are for never had much to spend on in the first place. From what I head, many of them don't even wear shoes.
Me seeing people actually burning Nike products they already paid for instead donating
I don't even own any Nike shoes so or otherwise they've nothing to loose from my boycott or not.
With u If u stand 4 nothing u fall for everything get fucked u losers, u burn it Ill buy it
Fuck the My boys love and that makes me proudLoving the Lebrons!
Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything
Burning them now so when ck is dropped he has to get more...
is ALL I wear.
I dont even wear Nike (my children do) but Im going to purchase a pair of walking shoes and see how they compare to my New Balance.
B like lets distract the public wit when we have a whole that should B impeached I think Ppl shud but things that matter like the government or president

Thatll show em! Destroy shit you already paid for! Im sure is sweating about losing that sock market.
Is a underway with the new campaign hiring
you want to boycott Nike, fine. But please don't destroy perfectly good clothing. Donate it. You probably drive past several drop boxes everyday.
Do not No No No yes yes yes

Guarantee the Trump cultists ranting and raving now will be wearing their favorite team's Nike apparel this coming .If not, views of the nekkid crowd could be both appalling and appealing.

Been doing a for decades. Inferior and overpriced product like UA. Ill stick with Puma/Adidas.
I think could've picked a better role model for their campaign... one who didn't wear socks with police as pigs.
Until I see someone burning Jordans (instead of all these bargain bin shoes) I wont laugh as hard at the latest fake outrage/internet attention called
Pig Socks 1's about to be hot on these streets

Im a size 12 for yall bitches send em my way
Someone tell these poorly educated trump voters, You already spent your money on the Nike gear you are burning. THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY ALREADY IDOIT.
If youre going to burn an article of clothing make sure youre still wearing it for maximum impact to the Libs.
Clearly the doesnt mean crap. If a company as big as they are will do a stunt like this, they dont need the $$ and also dont care what you are doing with your already paid for merch. p.s Kap was already a cocky mofo before the hype.


* Goes on a Nike buying spree instead *
Slowly will take an even bigger affect.
The NFL is ruined, so now lets ruin college football too and take from the young men who have that option to make their way in life. my family wont be watching your games unless you find suitable outfits for your players
Jheeze can you still buy these ?
Thank you for lowering the price amount "Today" ! Buying a couple of pairs... I'm getting the Nike Flex & Lebron 15Thanks again!

Instead of a , let's have a or . We certainly need to see less of those things!
Let's continue with the !
Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything
Remember K man had pigs on his socks representing police officers! Woah!! Think about that Nike!!

I will never buy another item of Nike merchandise. It is a boycott forever.


Social media bout to go off today
Million dollar idea for your buy first and destroy boycott needs: -branded coffee maker sold only at
You can't boycott if you don't understand the nature of a boycott. You can't retroactively boycott. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.
A communist endorsing a nothing to see here, folks!
Where's the lie?
*Sees trending**looks at trend thread*THAT'S ENOUGH TWITTER FOR TODAY.
I bet people upset with the are all for the Today's boycotts are stupid no matter which side they're on
These spoiled athletes are shitting all over the flag of the only county in the world that they can make millions playing a kid's game. A flag, I may add, that many fans have children defending with their lives.

Selfish people rather burn there Nike gear instead of donating them to shelters! and ignorant people in this world!
Instead of burning and destroying clothes and shoes that are in good condition, why dont yall donate the stuff? Im not understanding the logic at this point.
Good to know you BELIEVE IN SOMETHING!
Great. Idiots are burning Nikes now. I'm sure that's great for the environment. Why not burn all the jacked up trucks and Axe deodorant while we're at it?
Never buy EVER.
See ya

Soooo you are burning the gear YOU have already PURCHASED? Looks like Nike 1 You 0
Can we take a moment to reflect on the fact that this is the team of people who regularly call liberals snowflakes who are too easily offended?
Let's get to the point. If you are:1. Older than 22 (college agish) 2. Are not engaging in activities for purpose exercise. 3. Are not collecting a paycheck for activity related to wearing athletic shoes, and are wearing athletic shoes... your likely a loser.
's see. i am that poor african who walks around barefoot? it's actually good for your feet? people litter and this poor african child was walking over glass and chicken bones?i think that poor african is wearing nikes now? or puma? boycott? back to barefoot?
Hey dont forget to burn your college football gear. Alabama, Ole Miss, LSU, Arkansas, Georgia, Texas, Florida State, Ohio State and more are all Nike schools

Destroying something I already paid for to own the libs

BUYCOTT
yeah whatever. Very few are running or working out in anything that doesn't have a check on it. Get over yourselves. Go Cap Go.
Why would give credence to Kaprinick's false narrative?
Wait, if you're into , wouldn't it be more appropriate to shoot your Nike sneakers with an AR-15 than to burn them?
There's a certain, what is the word, pleasure? humor? in watching deplorables burn their $100 shoes...
is like the boycott they should all have some nike coffee and relax . These dudes cant tell what to boycott- lets start with real one is when Trump is impeached.
bye bye Nike
iBo ? No!
No more Nike for me. coming your way


people update me what Nike did ?
Ok, it would be almost impossible for me to boycott Nike.. dammit
Your soundman is tone deaf
Hummingbird Feeder Bird Hanging Plastic Water Drinking Bottle Dispenser Supply
Don't know what's more embarrassing, the people burning their socks, the ones congratulating themselves for (already) owning Nike stuff, or the ones running out and buying a new pair of trainers like it's some brave act?Hell of an ad campaign . Congrats.

To those people that are part of the and will now wear Converse instead


Kaepernick is an asshole, the entire kneeling during the National Anthem is self defeating, and Nike trying to glom on to the "resistance" zeitgeist is embarrasing, but or any boycott is pathetic and stupid.
That moment when you decide to UN-boycott after 15 years.
here's Hodges talking about MJ and the read Long Shot


When you go to hoop and Jake, the one that always try to daps you up is missing half the top of his socks
A few people destroying there Nike products isnt going to affect them in any way
Pretty sure Roger Goodall will do something stupid like ask players to take off their Nike shoes while the National Anthem is playing
You're gone from my life!
This is bullshit, if you dont like it, dont wear Nike clothing. Its that simple. Donate it, dont destroy it.

is a success and the boycott is a failure. =
marketing is about speaking to those you want to attract. The more polarizing,the more devoted fans.We can see who chose vs as here is an example where each talks to its ideal audience base. NO CONTEST on which side of history Id rather be on.
Nike is so mad the police won
Easy for me to boycott. Never bought Nike.
People destroying their Nike cuz of an ad? Y? Idiots... I love me some nike n Im definitely gonna buy some new shoes
Now yall mad about signing Colin but you guys were happy wearing it when sweatshops and children made your stuff for yoga class or football practice!?
Nike Sucks I Adidas
Instead of burning your Nikes T-shirts, sweat pants, shoes or hats, why not donate them to the homeless people in the streets or at some charity organization where people who dont have clothes can actually benefits from your kind gesture?
I didn't plan to, but now I'll go out and buy a pair.
This latest Trumpling effort to "boycott" a thing they already own is going about as stupidly as all the others, I see. Hey, wanna boycott my credit card bills next by giving me your money since clearly you suck at having it even more than I do?
Im a size youth 10-12 lol or a adult small so in other words if yall trynna send that Nike this way Ill take it
To all of you that's participating in the are fucking idiots BYEEEEEEE

To all the people "boycotting", y'all should donate your gear to homeless shelters. I'm sure they would love it.
Anyone giving away any size 13, Ill gladly take them off your hands if yall wanna keep being mad.

So True!
All of the people planning to boycott cant even afford maybe wait on your check..
BOYCOTT CNN AND ALL FAKENEWS BOYCOTT NIKE! bb
But....In our celebratory activism, let's not forget the questionable labor practices that go into Nike and other high ticket products. Our consumerism should never trump potentially unfair labor practices.
Increasing amount of money paid to sports star sponsorships vs the reduction in the final price actually going to workers.
I believe in something. I believe I will never buy another Nike product. PERIOD!
In celebration of it not being my birthday, I would like everyone not to engage in the .Godspeed.
you better hope your taxes are in order! I'm not a fan but will be sending IRS very soon!
Who did it better Coil or Porky.
If you are participating in the please unfollow me. I dont want anything to do with your ignorant, uneducated, hateful thinking.
Give me all your Nike stuff brah
Never liked Nike, they're made for Afroboned feet and ankles, don't fit my Caucasian feet well.
Goodbye, Nike! You gave me the perfect reason to stop buying your overpriced shoes. Here is real sacrifice:
Good to know all the MAGA trolls were tweeting their fingers off while I slept. ?
Nike today
I can't wait until next week when everyone has forgotten about the and and we move on to the next outrage-of-the-week. What are the odds it will revolve around ?
To anyone participating in the : Before you destroy your items, I wear a size 10 women's shoe. I will also accept any other nice items you have that you were planning to burn or cut up. P.S. Nike already has your money.
So you're burning and cutting up shit you've already bought?
Im buying double for all the ones that are |ing
How you boycott a company for doing good?
Ya'll pay attention to who is boycotting this will say a lot about coworkers friends, family members, and celebrities you follow...

Anyone giving away some size 13?
Here comes all the I'm cutting the Nike symbol off my Nike gear people

Wait, do you really think that Nike actually cares if you destroy their products that you ALREADY PAID FOR
I wasnt aware Walmart sold Nike gear.

one word, goodbye
Nike sport equipment upsetting you and youre wanting to burn it as well.
Instead, of burning those Nike shoes. Give them to someone in need.
I've lost all regret for that extravagant toddler Nikes purchase I made a few weeks ago. Even thinking I need a pair too now.

and two overrated products. Who cares. Its shoes and football. These people arent saving the world here.
Y'all let me know when the maga clowns are burning their brand new Nike college jerseys instead of old socks.
The best thing about this , the resell price will drop back to retail.Ive been wanting to buy the . & . collab. shoes. . . I need some Yeezys!
I stopped buying years ago when they started paying athletes $500 Million and the workers $5 a day.
Oh thanks for the reminder, I gotta get my Nike Vapormax today.


committing retail suicide.
This is stupid . If you dont know the truth of why Colin kneeled then stfu . TY for all you do and we will not
So many stupid people burning their Nike stuff do you honestly think Nike cares? You bought it

Anyone participating in this is a moron. That is all. Happy Tuesday, morons!
Yeah you go ahead and tear your Nike merchandise up, NOT I!
Well.... Colin and now can both fu** off!! Have a lovely day.
I see people are finally joining me in a . Their outsourced labor practices and targeting of poor youth to sell extremely overpriced products finally struck a cord with people, eh?
omg if yall are giving up your nike products, DM me. ill proudly wear it & it shouldnt go to waste
Last week, the other side boycotted a burger joint for donating to republicans. It never ends. I wonder if the left knows that Nike CEO donated 10x the amount to the GOP than the burger chain? smh
if anyone wants give their Nikes away Im willing to take them even as a conservative. Especially the socks I need some more socks.
Nobility sometimes satisfies the future.
Thanks u keep relevant dude hasnt played in 3 yrs yet trump cant help himself Nike playing you fat boy
You bet Im going to continue wearing these.

Instead of burning your shoes, why not donate them to the homeless?
Today is a good day to wear my Nikes to work.

Never buy from again. Nike joined the resist crowd.
Wow, this is the resistance?
We as Strong Nation will not endorse a product that choses a cop-hater, Colin Kaerpernick, to represent your brand. I will stand proudly behind the and My Flag. üïá
You can't be wearing Walmart shoes/socks and expect people to believe you own Nikes
Dear : F off!
il sest pass√© quoi encore?
Drop your shoes to half price on weekend and let's see how many continue to boycott.
Fair play to that lot.Takes a fair few brain cells to actively set fire to something you've already purchased. I'm sure Nike's profits will take a big hit.
So is trending following the Kaepernick news. FWIW, $NKE stock down more than 1% . But how big will any boycott be and will it really hit sales? Nike earnings out on September 25. We may learn more then.
Anyone in participating in can give your gear to me to give to homeless folk every Sunday as part of the
We know ya'll are going back into the trash to retrieve the merchandise you took a picture of as if you're really boycotting.
Next... they're gonna make you decide between peanut butter and jelly.

Buh bye, Nike.
Now that's a great idea.

I'll keep Serena as the "Mother of all of my Inspiration"...Thank you very much

Destroying something you ALREADY PAID for is not hurting Nike that is literally not the meaning of boycott.
People are actually burning their Nike stuff??

I'm not understanding this ... WHY are yall burning stuff you ALREADY BOUGHT and mad that is the new face of their new campaign
Good riddance NIKE!
Hey, Nike...buh bye.

O Yeah here we go this is what I was waiting on O butthurt ass people lol.
Destroying your own property to own the libs
Dear folks. Destroying your Nike stuff is about as effective as tossing your Keurigs out the window. The company already has your $$. Thats not how boycotts work.
Decisions Decisions
? With so many people in need? OK, why not give it to ? You are not proving anything accept how ignorant you are. And you call your self grown? It's A shame how one man has all this power over you and it's not God!

Chapeau Nike. Eure Schuhe mag ich deswegen immer noch nicht, aber das hat Stil. Und die Timeline kann man damit auch ganz gut aufr√§umen. Wenn auch nur auf Facebook. Bisher.

Fuck donating your shoes to the homeless, i'll take em, I'm broke as shit
once all these MAGA idiots get through with all these boycotts they'll be left shopping at The Dollar Tree which is fitting since that's about as much money as they'll have left when Trump finishes his looting
Nike executives reading these tweets.
When I was young, I couldnt convince my mom how necessary it was for me to have a pair of Nikes now I buy $200 work boots and wear sketchers n flip flops in my off time. This wont affect me. Not big on name brand garbage.
for what?YOU bought the merchandise, I'm sure destroying YOUR property won't bother ... YOU'LL be back when the new Jordans drop anyway
So what are new libs ruining today? Oh, their profits. Of course.
what you gonna do when you want to buy a Dak Prescott or Zeke Jersey but they wear Nike!!!?
Hey man, before you destroy your clothes, why not instead donate the clothes to homeless folk. I help run a meal every week in my town.

Perhaps with all these people participating in the , this increases my chances of finally copping limited releases on SNKRS. Thanks, Colin Kaepernick!
As a consumer, I am getting real tired of making a political statement simply by eating a chicken nugget or wearing a a pair of shoes. These companies need to stop letting themselves get bullied into taking a stance on social issues.
Folks participating in the are soooo dramatic.
seeing the people post criticizing others who are going to throw out their stuff then asking for it. I got 3 words for you.
Anyone in the states know a -er who wears size 13's?

I see this shit and i only wear Adidas but if it means that there's more nike stuff available in my sizes then by all means do what you want and boycott it so I can but some nice gear. Thank you in advance

All this is great news!! Maybe now I dont need an app to tell which humans are evolved ...
yes keep burning your gear, in a few months when you forget about it you will have to buy new ones.

In this case, I don't want nobody else to put my nike shoes, socks, etc. in their closets. They're going straight into the garbage. That doesn't change their bottom line; but what will change their bottom line is that I will NEVER buy from them again.

The ability to agree to disagree is paramount in any relationship that involves human to human connection. As a species we have lost the ability to do this for some reason

Let's ask ourselves, has any of their other boycotts worked?

Aye, if yall need rid of some of your Nike gear, let me know, Ill dispose of it for you

Seems like in our society today, everyone feels offended by something without knowing the full context of any given situation, and the is no different.

Nike is a major global company like the NBA. Your boycotts wont hurt either. Your boycotts really hasnt hurt the NFL either. The NFL still has the highest rated programming around so
Shoot, Ive been on the since 2010. They signed Kaepernick in 2011. Youre late to the party and you came for the wrong reasons.

I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeee being part of the .

Twitter war breaks out over Kaepernick Nike Link:

Yes, we are burning all Nike products we own.
I wore my Nike's yesterday, I wore em 2day too and for dam sure I'm gonna be wearing em tom

Burning a company's product that you've already actually purchased: The ultimate form of boycotting.
I dont understand the point of destroying your own clothes and posting it on Twitter when all its doing to Nike is giving them Publicity

don't forget Nike owns Hurley and Converse too. So stop buying those as well.
So so so so so much this
No more for this family.
To all you folks boycotting Nike I wear a size 8-8.5 You know what to do
Never ever buy anything .
I like when dumb hashtags like trend overnight. It's easy to spot the Moscow morning shift to block the bots.
This is going to work as good as those Keurig, Budweiser, Hawaii and Star Wars boycotts!
FYI for anyone disposing of their Nike gear. I wear size 8 1/2 or 9 in womens and 7 in mens. I also wear a medium in the clothing line. DM me for my mailing address.
Yeah dont forget to burn all that stuff! These people are see through like glass!
We stand with - and the movement.

PLEASE, no matter how upset you are, DONATE your Nike items, don't burn them. You might not need them, but other people do


You know how retarded you gotta be to boycott Nike by tweeting about Nike?
If the people boycotting Nike spent all their energy on protecting stricter gun laws instead of watching innocent children get murdered in school, maybe Id care about their movement.
So much

You hoes are obsessed with burning shit!! I guess better shoes than crosses

Only idiot butt-tRumpers would burn shoes they already paid for, that Nike has already been paid for, and think they have actually accomplished anything. Well, other than having one less pair or shoes. Sad!
Here are some alternatives for your Nike shoes

Hey yall go ahead and do what you want and burn your shit. But if one of yall come and step on my sneakers trying to do some fuck shit, please believe imma leave Nike check marks on ya face.

or at least donate them to homeless charities rather than destroying them like a pouty little brat
Stand for yourself. Be a fan of YOU! Nothing else will pay you.
THIS.....................................................................

Donate your shoes instead of destroying them. The homeless don't have the luxury of virtue signaling. ,

Hey conservative men, Dont worry about Nike. Stick to what you know:

Once again conservatives prove they have no idea how to boycott. Also, instead of cutting holes out of your clothes, you could donate them, assholes. Of course, that might help someone else and you all aren't into that kind of thing.
although we did it the FIRST TIME perfectly. Why y'all mad tho?
Its not about destroying products its about not buying them at all.

Hellllooo burning their OWN money that they spent already OKAY I hear you
Either is blind or their Ad Agency and Advertising Manager live in another world. Probably the latter. Somehow I dont think they know what they have done. No football, no Nike
What is it with fascists and setting things on fire?
Gonna be a huge disturbance in The Force today when millions of people wearing Nike go to eat at a Chik-Fil-A or an In-N-Out Burger.

How about donating your clothes instead of destroying them?
I tani wih Colin the change u want to see
target demo that buys Nike stands with His jersey is one of the best sellers and dude don't even play in the league. This is only going to make him iconic...so keep up the good work.
Ugly sneakers made of cheap plastic that cost hundreds of dollars. A corporation that pays its workers less than 23 cents an hour. Why anyone wears this junk in the first place is a mystery to me.
Only idiot butt-tRumpers would burn shoes they already paid for, that Nike has already been paid for, and think they have actually accomplished anything. Well, other than having one less pair or shoes. Sad!
I will be donating my items to Goodwill and pledge not to buy any more of their products for myself or my family

Why does it gotta be boycott? Why not girlcott? Don't assume my...
Gladly accepting all unwanted Nike gear!

Imagine being so ignorant that you have to make up shit to be mad about.
Last week, it was . This week, it's .Don't you people ever get tired of these stupid boycotts?
No more for me!
Today conservatives are boycotting our leading sweatshop operator, while liberals are driving stock to new highs. Who would have thought?
Believe in something...even if it means sacrificing everything.
???? Aint no boycott bitch
lemmings are delighted to have yet another physical object on which to express their rage. You can't lynch people any more, so you may as well lynch your sneakers.

Waiting on all the photos of the morons in their new
I don't much care about what brand is on my shoe, but this whole thing smacks of a long-con by Nike to make sure that that their virtue signaling campaigns keep eyes off the sweatshop conditions in its factories. Fairly cynical.
check NFL players not all... but many of these so-called fans (Trumpers) who cheer for U who praise U are not your fans after a couple of six packs behind closed doors they're calling U the n word
Colonizers trying to boycott Nike is funny to me.

Hey you fans.. Deal is to 2033.. I wear a size 10 in shoes..

Do you think that Twitter is suppressing this hashtag to some degree? I think it is trending bigger than they are showing
Yall MAGAs man
I can afford a pair of new trainers once every three years. I ain't burning shit.
Boycotting hurts more people than the target. That being said, Nike hasn't made anything worth owning since 1994. Then the whole sweatshop thing. Not to mention was a mediocre bench warmer who didn't sacrifice anything, He politicized a dying sport.
It is Nike sacrificing everything. I wont be buying any Nikes.
why? Al he wants is his voice to be heard. Go ahead and destroy your fucking sneakers, yall stupid and go ahead and waste your money darlings
Since there is a , I will buy ONLY NIKE EVERYTHING from now on. As long as Nike makes it, I'm buying it there.If they open a Nike grocery store, that's where I'm buying tomatoes.

Hey I wear a women's size 8. I'll take your boycotted nikes.
Ive probably spent well over 10 g's on Nike gear in my life. From jerseys to sneakers to golf, baseball, hockey equipment. Looks like its Adidas and others from now on. Have fun catering to a bunch of libs who dont even play sports so wont buy you're equipment
Everybody jumping on this and Im sitting here thinking  is still a thing?, is still relevant?
To the morons destroying their items, how about you donate them instead? Sure you dont want them anymore (stupid), but give them to people who maybe doesnt have/cant afford shoes, socks, clothes, etc.
What a fantastic development! Now we have two ways to be able to spot before accidentally inviting them to a dinner party..... Stupid red ball caps and now an absence of NIKE branded clothing

I love my Nikes. Even more so now.
Anybody throwing away size 8.5 I know a good home they could go too!

How about instead of destroying the Nike products you already own you donate them instead
yall got sales going on now ?
I will no longer be purchasing Nike products do to their selection of a new spokesperson.
Stop cutting up and burning your Nike apparel and donate it to people who fucking need that shit
really, have you lost your mind! Ok lets see how big an impact we can make burning our Nike and not buying anything with Nike on it. Now we can take a stand
Damn. I guess I have to start buying overpriced Nike shit now.
isn't trump's base running out of things to boycottand it's not like they are known for their footwear(more the lack of it)
Nike is done for!! Millions will be lost in market share today. Broke Libtards dont own stock in companies thats a fact. Major selloff in 3 hours. I cant wait hahahahaha Libtard Tears 24/7
Who could have seen this coming?


look at all the MAGA babies cry
thought with its feet, not its head.
Nike is a billion dollar company that makes money all over the world. Theyll be ok without your MAGA money
Hold strong Nike!
I really hope theres a hardcore conservative with a Nike tattoo out there. Id love to see how that goes down.
This trend is so pathetic Im on looking for a new pair of sneakers
Who cares?

For all those idiots cutting up their clothes and burning their trainers. Youve already given Nike your money you fuckwits.
I am not a ‚Äò name brand kind of person. I try my best to even avoid ‚Äò made in China ‚Äò products. here should be a reason why:
stocks going up...on a Tuesday.
I am laughing at all of the idiots burning their Nike products. As long as you paid for the products, Nike does not care.
I will take any being donated. Im poor. My son and I will gladly take it. So instead of burning it or trashing it dm me and send it my way
Yo any snowflake trump fans crying over spilled milk today, if you're thinking of boycotting Nike and getting rid of any shoes in size 10 or 11 gimme a bell, I'd be interested in buying
Nike, hope your stand for loser Kaepernick is worth it. Wont buy Nike again.
For those burning their shoes and socks. You can donate them to your local shelters or to the homeless. If not I wear size 8.5-9 in women and 6 in men.
you will damage Nike even more than you damaged with your pathetic victimhood campaign!
I think we know what the is all about.
I wanted to let folks know when trending feel relevant with my situation I will be posting on them & wanted to add context to the Nike post which I have considered removing, but should I? below are my thoughts, what are yours?
Everyone on this hashtag. I bet you dont even stand for the national anthem at home while watching any sport so stop the fake outrage. You sit on the couch like every other person on Sunday night football. So STFU.
Im too broke to buy new Nikes but these spoiled brats burn theirs? Heres an idea..donate them to a homeless shelter or give them away!

In lieu of this fake . Yall cutting ya nike socks up. Who's this hurt?! You already paid for the item, DUMMY. toilet tissue companies sell u the tissue B4 you get it home.. Long as They have their money you can wipe ya ass with what you bought for all they care.

I swear people boycott anything for the stupidest reasons lmao.
"Oh no, I'm boycotting !"- Old hardcore conservative who hasn't exercised since he last hit his mistress
Sit on this
In an effort to reinforce the idea that taking a knee is acceptable anytime, Nike hires Dorf as their new mascot for their Nike shoe commercials.

If wants to make a real statement, he should donate every penny to giving Nikes to those who need a pair of shoes.
Now this some Donald trump shit smh


If you wear you're a Jewish supremacist
If you own NIKE stock. Better sell today!


What happened with Nike?
What an idiot. This is not hurting ! He already paid for the socks! And by the way, this guy needs to go back to kindergarten to learn how to cut in a straight line...
Nike to anyone boycotting their stores
QUITE!
Nike have fucked up big time with their new campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick and stating he has sacrificed everything. They are going to have a huge backlash now, many will boycott.

Welp not buying my kids school shoes again!
So does this mean the killings in Chicago are over now??
Im burning all my Nike products,
Imagine being so weak in character, so unable to think for yourself, so easy to influence that the MAGA cult leader tells you to get angry at something and you burn your clothesFor something you didnt give 2 shits about before Orange Donald told you to

Time to tell the shoe burning magas that, "Converse" means, "Conservative-Universe" and then not let on that owns them.

This made me laugh more than it should
Nike secret HQ revealed!

Hoping I can get some AF1s or blazers on the cheap now tbh :)

Hey I dont know about this new ad campaign. You might want to rethink it.
You fucked up! Never buying Nike or any thing of any company apart of them.


Sorry Nike, this is what it looks like to ACTUALLY sacrifice everything.

Nike's 1934 ad campaign.


Sacrificed everything? No these men sacrificed everything. You are one screwed up company.
Colin Kaepernick is a talented Athlete . Let him play , differences can be resolved later .
Their shoes have been limited over years in wide (where I went to buy them) - therefore - I dont like the product - & why not boycott them anyway - kapernick is an ingrate - Aloha nike probably likes controversial advertising anyway -

anyone throwing their nike pumps out in anger ill have all your size 10s... cheers.
- Goodbye and goodnight...
Ruining your own stuff to own the libs is really stupid. Exceedingly stupid. Its stupidity on display.
Oh noooo...what'll they do?

What does ruining your clothes do? Nike already got your money and now you need new pants



Word







Nike wins


Sacrificing everything?

Stop burning toxic shoes Recycle or donate them

Today Predictions have been added. Kindly check them here
What are good for, taking you to the store and buying .
This is the ad should be running. If youre burning your shoes or tossing them out, please take them to a homeless shelter or to your local schools for folks who could at least benefit from them.

What are up to? Whats this all about?

People are stupid for burning their own Nike products... like so... do you not understand Nike already got your money, they don't care if you burn their products. At the end of the day they got what they wanted! If you don't want your Nike's, send them my way!
Is this winning?
As a 49er fan I can honestly say that I was truly happy they let kaepernick go...he couldnt hit the broad side of a barn he had no touch and he had rock for brains...couldnt read coverages and make progressions through plays then he started kneeling DUMB!
Guess I no longer will purchase Nike shoes or their clothing line!
Why is everyone burning nike gear? What is happening kanti?

Outstanding. If these ass maggots want to wax political.....than they will pay the price.
I'm glad that only the cool kids are going to be wearing from now on! To all of you intellectual-infants burning your Nike gear...."Buh-Bye"!!

Good-Bye.......
hey all you losers.....make sure you ditch your Converse too cuz Nike owns them now. No more Chucks for you.

Is this for real???

Sorry had to retweet this...
"Even though he is one of the worst one trick west coast running pony quarterbacks NOT in the league."There. Fixed it for you there killer.
Too bad we couldn't appoint Colin Kaepernick the new face of the NRA; then maybe these whiny babies would boycott something worthwhile.
Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.
You are redefining the definition of star athlete and infamy has nothing to do with athletic ability.
You are so mad that you are literally burning and cutting stuff you already paid for, pay it forward and donate it dummies.
People out here really burning their Nike stuff?!
From Riches to Rags!
If you shoes in a then you are stupid. Give them to a homeless person and stop being a dumb when someone else practices their you
Creative execution + spend x controversy = big hit brand campaign. Nike arent stupid, but they arent Pippy Longstockings either - this is a calculated and balanced brand manoeuvre, nothing more, nothing less.
New theme song
Believe in something....

You people are really "sticking it to " and everyone else who doesn't agree with you by burning and destroying your own belongings. That'll show them. Get over yourselves.
